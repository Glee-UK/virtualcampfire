# Notes
- The site is hosted on github pages.
- SVG icons came from https://uxwing.com/

# Local development
To generate a list page run:
```
python jinja_site.py index.txt
```
Then open index.html file in a browser.

To generate a song page run:
```
python jinja_site.py Worried_Man.html
```
Then open Worried_Man.html file in a browser.

To generate all song pages run:
```
python jinja_site.py lyrics/
```

# Updating the site
Any change pushed to the branch gh-pages will be reflected on the site.
This is done by a Github action that runs the script `site_jinja.py` 
and commits the changes to the gh-pages branch.


# Lyric format 
The lyrics are html files with a strict format, stored in the `lyrics` directory.
The expected html tags are: 
- title
- h1
- pre
- i is used to indicate chorus

# Naming convention

The naming convention is 
```
mp3/<Song Title>_(<Song Version>).mp3
```
This is parsed to get the lyric file name. 
```
lyrics/<Song Title>.html
```
All versions of a song have only one lyrics file. 
This maybe a weakness.


# Song Data
Apart from the song file name and some meta data in the mp3 files themselves we have a Google sheet 
This can be downloaded using this url
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Beh2H4Hxyz5OTgBWB4afx0h_gpxcHu785-k6Gbtc0lI/gviz/tq?tqx=out:csv&sheet=Songs
and saved as songs.csv


# Song  Ingestion Process

1. Ideally you know when and where recorded
2. Download from email/whatsapp using the naming convention (regardless of mp3/mp4)

5. Update lyrics/<Song Title>.html with the lyrics from a PDF of the songbook or from the web
6. git add mp3/<Song Title>.mp3 lyrics/<Song Title>.html
7. python validate.py
8. Copy output to the right place in songs.csv
9. python make_songbooks_from_songs.py
10. git commit -m "Added <Song Title>"
