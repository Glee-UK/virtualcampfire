  Poor Orphan Child

<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>
I hear a low faint voice that says
Papa and mama's dead
And it comes from the poor orphan child
That must be clothed and fed
And it comes from the poor orphan child
That must be clothed and fed
And it comes from the poor orphan child
That must be clothed and fed

Savior, lead them by the hand
Savior, lead them by the hand
Savior, lead them by the hand
Till they all reach that glittering strand

And now we see those wandering curls
Hang careless 'round their brow
They say to us, my papa's dead
And I've no mother now
They say to us, my papa's dead
And I've no mother now
They say to us, my papa's dead
And I've no mother now

Savior, lead them by the hand
Savior, lead them by the hand
Savior, lead them by the hand
Till they all reach that glittering strand

They call from many children's mouths
Poor little boys and girls
Who want that mother's loving hand
To smooth their golden curls
Who want that mother's loving hand
To smooth their golden curls
Who want that mother's loving hand
To smooth their golden curls

Savior, lead them by the hand
Savior, lead them by the hand
Savior, lead them by the hand
Till they all reach that glittering strand
