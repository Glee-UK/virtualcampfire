 <i>
 Here’s one, two, three jolly lads all in one mind
 We are come a pace egging and I hope you’ll prove kind
 And I hope you’ll prove kind with your eggs and strong beer
 For we’ll come no more nigh you until the next year
 </i>
And the first to come in is Lord Nelson you’ll see
With a bunch of blue ribbons tied round by his knee
And a star on his breast that like silver doth shine
And I hope he remembers it’s pace egging time

And the next to come in, it is Lord Collingwood
And he fought with Lord Nelson till he shed his blood
And he’s come from the sea, Old England to view
And he’s come a pace-egging with all of his crew

And the last to come in is old Toss Pot you’ll see
He’s a valiant old man and in every degree
He’s a valiant old man and he wears a pig tail
And his only delight is a-drinking mulled ale

Come ladies and gentlemen, sit by the fire
Put your hands in your pockets and give us our desire
Put your hands in your pockets and treat us all right
If you give nowt we’ll take nowt, farewell and goodnight
