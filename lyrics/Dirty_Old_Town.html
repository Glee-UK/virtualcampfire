<pre>
I met my love by the gasworks wall
Dreamed a dream by the old canal
Kissed my girl by the factory wall
Dirty old town, dirty old town

I heard the siren from the docks
Saw a train set the night on fire
Smelt the spring on the smoky air
Dirty old town, dirty old town

The clouds are drifting across the moon
Cats are prowling on their beat
Spring’s a girl in the street at night

Dirty old town, dirty old town
I’m going to take a good sharp axe
Shining steel tempered in the fire
We’ll chop you down like an old dead tree
Dirty old town, dirty old town
