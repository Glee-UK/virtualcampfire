<pre>
Johnny Boy go home, to the land you know
There’s a warm fire burning, a place set at your table
Johnny Boy go home, far away from this place
Please remember the morning mist, feel the sun on your face
 <i>
 See the light shining, shining on the water’s edge
 Warm away the winter chill with the joy that you
 bring into my heart
 See the light shining, shining on the water’s edge
 Warm away the winter chill with the joy that you
 bring into my heart
 </i>
Johnny Boy go home, to the land you know
There’s a future calling you, there’s a future calling me
Johnny Boy go home, far away from this place
Please remember the morning mist, feel the sun on your face
