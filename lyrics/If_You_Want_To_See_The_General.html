If you want to see the General, I know where he is,
I know where he is, I know where he is.
If you want to see the General, I know where he is,
He’s pinning another medal on his chest.
I saw him, I saw him, pinning another medal on his chest,
I saw him, pinning another medal on his chest.

If you want to see the Colonel, I know where he is,
I know where he is, I know where he is.
If you want to see the Colonel, I know where he is,
He’s sitting in comfort stuffing his bloody face.
I saw him, I saw him, sitting in comfort stuffing his bloody face,
I saw him, sitting in comfort stuffing his bloody face.

If you want to see the Sergeant, I know where he is,
I know where he is, I know where he is.
If you want to see the Sergeant, I know where he is,
He’s drinking all the Company’s rum.
I saw him, I saw him, drinking all the Company’s rum,
I saw him, drinking all the Company’s rum.

If you want to see the Private, I know where he is,
I know where he is, I know where he is.
If you want to see the Private, I know where he is,
He’s hanging on the old barbed wire.
I saw him, I saw him, hanging on the old barbed wire,
I saw him, hanging on the old barbed wire.
