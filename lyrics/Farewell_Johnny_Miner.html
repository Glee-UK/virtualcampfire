Johnny Miner you were born
Never to see the rising dawn
Now it’s time that you were gone
Farewell Johnny Miner
<i>
 Farewell Durham and Yorkshire too
 Nottingham the same to you
 Scotland, South Wales bid “Adieu”
 Farewell Johnny Miner
</i>
They promised you the earth sometimes
To dig coal from their stinking mines
And all the justice for their crimes
Is Farewell Johnny Miner
<i>
 Farewell Durham and Yorkshire too
 Nottingham the same to you
 Scotland, South Wales bid “Adieu”
 Farewell Johnny Miner
</i>
You’ve battled with the sliding scale
Lungs turned black and faces pale
Now your body’s up for sale
Farewell Johnny Miner
<i>
 Farewell Durham and Yorkshire too
 Nottingham the same to you
 Scotland, South Wales bid “Adieu”
 Farewell Johnny Miner
</i>
Come on John, don’t take it hard
Unemployment isn’t bad
They’ll treat you well in the knacker’s yard
Farewell Johnny Miner
<i>
 Farewell Durham and Yorkshire too
 Nottingham the same to you
 Scotland, South Wales bid “Adieu”
 Farewell Johnny Miner
