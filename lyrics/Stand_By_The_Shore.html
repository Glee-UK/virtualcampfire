Brothers now, our meeting is over
Brothers we must part
And if we should never meet again
I'll love you in my heart
And we'll stand by the shore
And we'll stand by the shore
And we'll stand by the shore
And we'll watch for evermore

Sisters now, our meeting is over
Sisters we must part
And if we should never meet again
I'll love you in my heart
And we'll stand by the shore
And we'll stand by the shore
And we'll stand by the shore
And we'll watch for evermore

Fathers now, our meeting is over
Fathers, we must part
And if we should never meet again
I'll love you in my heart
And we'll stand by the shore
And we'll stand by the shore
And we'll stand by the shore
And we'll watch for evermore
 
Mothers now, our meeting is over
Mothers, we must part
And if we should never meet again
I'll love you in my heart
And we'll stand by the shore
And we'll stand by that shore
And we'll stand by the shore
And we'll watch for evermore

Sinners now, our meeting is over
Sinners, we must part
And if we should never meet again
I'll love you in my heart
And we'll stand by the shore
And we'll stand by that shore
And we'll stand by the shore
And we'll watch for evermore
