Bright morning star arising
Bright morning star arising
Bright morning star arising
Day is a-breaking in my soul

Oh where are our dear fathers?
Oh where are our dear fathers?
Oh where are our dear fathers?
Day is a-breaking in my soul

Some have gone to heaven shouting
Some have gone to heaven shouting
Some have gone to heaven shouting
Day is a-breaking in my soul

Some are down in the valley praying
Some are down in the valley praying
Some are down in the valley praying
Day is a-breaking in my soul

Bright morning stars are rising
Bright morning stars are rising
Bright morning stars are rising
Day is a-breaking in my soul
