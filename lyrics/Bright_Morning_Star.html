Bright morning star arising
Bright morning star arising
Bright morning star arising
Day is a-breaking in my soul

Oh where are our dear fathers?
Oh where are our dear fathers?
They are down in the valley a-praying
Day is a-breaking in my soul

Oh where are our dear mothers?
Oh where are our dear mothers?
They have gone to heaven a-shouting
Day is a-breaking in my soul

Bright morning star a-rising
Bright morning star a-rising
Bright morning star a-rising
Day is a-breaking in my soul
