<h1>
Rose Of Aberdeen
</h1>
<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>
I'm a rambler I'm a gambler
I'm a long way from my home
If you people don't like me
I can make out on my own

'Cause it's dark
And it's raining
And the moon gives no light
And my pony can hardly travel
On this long and drawn out night

You know once I had a true love
Though her age was just sixteen
She was the flower of Beltain
And the rose of Aberdeen

But her parents did not like me
And now she feels much the same
If I'm written in your diary
Then blot out my name

'Cause there's changes in the ocean
And there's changes in the sea
And there's changes in my own true love
But there ain't no change in me

I'm a rambler I'm a gambler
I'm a long way from my home
If you people don't like me
I can make out on my own
