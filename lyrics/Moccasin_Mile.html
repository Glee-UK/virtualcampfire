 Moccasin Mile

<pre>
To step in the shoes our ancestors used
To map out the paths that we tread
Is to unravel time and sling them a line
They’ve written from the history we’ve read
 <i>
 Now the struggle is on for where we belong
 Don’t shrink from the task that’s at hand
 ‘Cause I’m steeply inclined to walk a moccasin mile
 For the love of my fellow human
 </i>
To rebuild upon the toil that’s been done
Is to continue elevation
Of the framework of those, the ancients who know
How to generate veneration
Now the struggle is on for where we belong...

(Bridge:)<i>
To soar above the mighty lake
Touch down where angels stand
Is to journey within for wisdom’s sake
And awake to replenish the land
</i>
To order our thought and speak the report
Of experience up to this day
Is to throw to the wind every deep engraving
And watch as they blow all away
<i>Now the struggle is on for where we belong...</i>

So honour is due to the ones who pursue
The fulfilment of life’s divine plan And I’m steeply inclined to walk a moccasin mile
For the love of my fellow human
Now the struggle is on for where we belong
Don’t shrink from the task that’s at hand
‘Cause I’m steeply inclined to walk a moccasin mile
For the love of my fellow human
 <i>
To soar above the mighty lake
Touch down where angels stand
Is to journey within for wisdom’s sake
And awake to replenish the land
 </i>
