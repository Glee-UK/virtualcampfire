 What will we do

<pre>
What will we do when we’ll have no money
All true lovers, what will we do then
Only hawk through the town for a hungry crown
And we’ll yodel it over again

What will I do if I’d marry a tinker
All true lovers, what will we do then
Only sell a tin can and walk on with my man
And we’ll yodel it over again

What will we do if we marry a soldier
All true lovers, what will we do then
Only handle his gun and we’ll fight for the fun
And we’ll yodel it over again

What will we do if we have a young daughter
All true lovers, what would we do then
Only take her in hand and walk on with my man
And we’ll yodel it over again
