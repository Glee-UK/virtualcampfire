We come on the sloop John B
My grandfather and me
‘Round Nassau town we did roam
Drinkin’ all night, got into a fight
I feel so break up, I want to go home
 <i>
So hoist up the John B sails
See how the main sail sets
Send for the Captain ashore, let me go home
Please let me alone, I want to go home
I feel so break up, I want to go home
 </i>
The first mate, oh, he got drunk
He broke up the people’s trunk
Constable had to come and take him away
Sheriff Johnstone please let me alone
I feel so break up, I want to go home

The cook he got the fits
Ate up all of my grits
Then he went and ate up all of my corn
O let me go home, please let me go home
This is the worst trip I’ve ever been on
