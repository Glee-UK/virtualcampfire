<pre>
To those who live in cities where bricks and mortar’s seen,
There’s nothing so refreshing as a little bit of green;
So often on a summer’s day an idle hour to pass
Off to the fields I'll get away and roll upon the grass.

<i>
Rolling on the grass amidst the buttercups and daisies,
That’s the way, that’s the way an idle hour to pass.
Rolling on the grass amidst the buttercups and daisies,
Fancying you’re a child again and rolling on the grass.
</i>

The prettiest of carpet stairs that ever could be found,
With daisies sprinkled here and there and May bushes around,
A bright blue roof above o’er which the silver clouds sail by,
And sky larks think it such a lark to sing up in the sky.

One day when I reclining was and half inclined to dream
I suddenly was startled by a female’s piercing scream;
Towards me ran a pretty girl in a fearful state of mind
And followed by a frantic cow unpleasantly behind.

 [Spoken]
 Now to get to me feet and catch the fainting damsel in me arms was
 but the work of a quarter of a minute,
 and the cow seeing my defiant action came to a full stop and stared.
 Then, taking my cap in hand, I said,
 (action of cap waving required here)
 ‘Go away, cow, go away!’
 And so she did, and sent us both

I often met her after that and this was my excuse
That if a frantic cow turn up I might perhaps be of use;
She’s going to change her name to mine when a few short months shall pass,
And so I bless that blessed cow and rolling on the grass.
