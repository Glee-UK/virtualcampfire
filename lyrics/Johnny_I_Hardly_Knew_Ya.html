<pre>
While going the road to sweet Athy, hurroo, hurroo
While going the road to sweet Athy, hurroo, hurroo
While going the road to sweet Athy
A stick in me hand and a tear in me eye
A doleful damsel I heard cry,
Johnny I hardly knew ya
 <i>
 With your drums and guns and drums and guns,
 Hurroo, hurroo
 With your drums and guns and drums and guns,
 Hurroo, hurroo
 With your drums and guns and drums and guns
 The enemy nearly slew ye
 Oh my darling dear, Ye look so queer
 Johnny I hardly knew ya
 </i>
Where are your eyes that looked so mild, hurroo, hurroo
Where are your eyes that looked so mild, hurroo, hurroo
Where are your eyes that looked so mild
When my heart you so beguiled
Why did ye skeddadle from me and the child
Johnny, I hardly knew ya

Where are your legs that used to run, hurroo, hurroo
Where are your legs that used to run, hurroo, hurroo
Where are your legs that used to run
When you went for to carry a gun
Indeed your dancing days are done
Oh Johnny, I hardly knew ya

Ye haven’t an arm, ye haven’t a leg, hurroo, hurroo
Ye haven’t an arm, ye haven’t a leg, hurroo, hurroo
Ye haven’t an arm, ye haven’t a leg
Ye’re an armless, boneless, chickenless egg
Ye’ll have to be put with a bowl to beg
Oh Johnny I hardly knew ya

I’m happy for to see ye home, hurroo, hurroo
I’m happy for to see ye home, hurroo, hurroo
I’m happy for to see ye home
All from the island of Sulloon
So low in flesh, so high in bone
Johnny I hardly knew ya

But sad it is to see you so, hurroo, hurroo
But sad it is to see you so, hurroo, hurroo
But sad it is to see you so
And to think of you now as an object of woe
Your Peggy will still keep you on as her beau
Johnny I hardly knew ya

They’re rolling out the guns again, hurroo, hurroo
They’re rolling out the guns again, hurroo, hurroo
They’re rolling out the guns again
To fight the wars in France and Spain
But they never will take our sons again
Johnny I’m swearing to ya
