  Down where the Drunkards Roll
</h1>
<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>
See the boys out walking, the boys they look so fine
Dressed up in green velvet, their silver buckles shine
Soon they’ll be bleary-eyed under a keg of wine
 <i>
 Down where the drunkards roll
 Down where the drunkards roll
 </i>
See that lover standing staring at the ground
He’s looking for the real thing, lies were all he found
But you can get the real thing, it will only cost a pound

There goes a troubled woman, she dreams a troubled dream
She lives out on the highway, she keeps her money clean
Soon she’ll be returning to the place where she’s the queen

You can be a gambler who never drew a hand
You can be a sailor, never left dry land
You can be Lord Jesus, all the world will understand
