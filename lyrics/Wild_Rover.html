<pre>
I’ve been a wild rover for many a year
And I’ve spent all my money on whisky and beer
And now I’m returning with gold in great store
And I never will play the wild rover no more
 <i>
 And it’s no, nay, never
 No nay never no more
 Will I play the wild rover
 No never no more
 </i>

I went into an ale-house I used to frequent
And I told the landlady my money was spent
I asked her for credit, she answered me “Nay,
Such a custom as yours I can get any day”

I drew from my pocket ten sovereigns bright
And the landlady’s eyes opened wide with delight
She said “I have whisky, and wines of the best
And the words that I spoke then were only in jest”

I’ll have none of your whisky nor fine Spanish wines
For your words show you plainly as no friend of mine
There’s others most willing will open the door
To a man coming home from a far distant shore

I’ll go home to my parents, confess what I’ve done
And ask them to pardon their prodigal son
And if they will do so, as oft times before
Then I never will play the wild rover no more
