<h1>
  Going Over Jordan
</h1>
<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>
Traveling through this world below
I have no sickness, toil, nor danger
In that bright world to which I go
I'm going there to meet my father
I'm going there no more to roam

I'm just going over Jordan
I'm just going over home

I know dark clouds will gather o'er me
I know my pathway is rough and steep
But golden fields lie down before me
Where weary eyes no more shall weep
I'm going there to meet my mother
And she said she'd greet me when I come

I'm just going over Jordan
I'm just going over home

I want to sing salvation's glory
In concert with the blood-washed band
I want to wear the crown of glory
When I get home to that good land
I am going there to meet my hap crew
Who went before me one by one

I'm just going over Jordan
I'm just going over home
