Three is a magic number.
Yes it is, it's a magic number.

It takes three legs to make a tri-pod or to make a table stand.
It takes three wheels to make a ve-hicle called a tricycle.
Every triangle has three corners,
Every triangle has three sides,
No more, no less.
You don't have to guess.
When it's three you can see it's a magic number.

A man and a woman had a little baby
Yes, they did.
They had three in the family
That's the magic number.

Three is a magic number.
Yes it is, it's a magic number.
Somewhere in the ancient, mystic trinity
You get three as a magic number.

The past and the present and the future,
Faith and hope and charity,
The heart and the brain and the body
Give you three.
That's the magic number.

A man and a woman had a little baby
Yes, they did.
They had three in the family
That's the magic number.

 3, 6, 9
 12, 15, 18
 21, 24, 27
 30.
 3, 6, 9
 12, 15, 18
 21, 24, 27
 30.
 3, 6, 9
 12, 15, 18
 21, 24, 27
 30.

Now the multiples of three come up three times in each set of ten.
In the first ten you get three six nine
In the teens, you get twelve fifteen and eighteen
And in the twenties you get twenty-one, twenty-four, twenty-seven
And it comes out even on thirty

Now Multiply it backwards and you get
Three times ten is 30
Three times nine is 27
Three times eight is 24
Three times seven is 21
Three times six is 18, three times five is 15
Three times four is twelve
And three times three is nine and three times two is six.
And three times one is three of course.
Because that's the magic number.

Three is the magic number.
One two three is the magic number
Three is the magic number.
Yes it is
Three is the magic number.

3, 6, 9,
12, 15, 18,
21, 24, 27
30.

Three times ten is... 30
Three times nine is 27
Three times eight is... 24
Three times seven is... 21
Three times six is 18, three times five is 15,
Three times four is twelve
And three times three is nine and three times two is six.
And three times one...
Is three of course because
That's a magic number.

One two three is the magic number
Yes it is

A man and a woman had a little baby.
Yes, they did.
They had three in the family.
That's a magic number.
Three is a magic number.

One two three is the magic number
Yes it is
