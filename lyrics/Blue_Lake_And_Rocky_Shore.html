<h1>
Blue Lake and Rocky Shore
</h1>
<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>

Land of the silver birch, 
home of the beaver,
Where still the mighty moose 
wanders at will.

Chorus
Blue lake and rocky shore, 
I will return once more.
Um pum pum tiddly um pum pum

My heart is sick for you 
here in the lowlands,
I will return to you 
hills of the north.

Swift as a silver fish, 
canoe of birch bark
Thy mighty waterways 
carry me forth.

There where the blue lake lies, 
I'll set my wigwam
Close to the water's edge, 
silent and still.
