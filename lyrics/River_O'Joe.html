Well we left the city and the fourteenth floor
We went down by the river o’ Joe
Though then we never knew what we were travelling for
We went down by the river o’ Joe
Thirty miles to a place that we had not seen
Where the land lies flat and the wind blows keen
It was the prettiest place I’ve ever been,
Down by the river o’ Joe.
 <i>
 Oh the river, oh the river, oh the river o’ Joe
 The river ain’t never for sale
 I was born by the river o’ Joe
 And the river ain’t never for sale
 You can make your deals in the dead of night
 You can bribe who the bloody hell you like
 But I was born by the river o’ Joe
 And the river ain’t never for sale
 </i>
Me dad got a job on the factory floor
Down by the river o' Joe
With a house for his kids and so much more
Down by the river o' Joe
It was through the door and through the gate
There was me, me brother and a new found mate
Under the mother of moons ‘til late
Down by the river o' Joe

Well they say one time for a week it poured
Down by the river o' Joe,
‘Til all you could hear was a pounding roar
Down by the river o' Joe
They tried to save the church with sand and planks
But the river kept on rising ‘til it burst it’s banks
Pretty soon the whole street got sank
Down by the river o' Joe

Well many more days and good times there are
Down by the river o' Joe
When people travelled from miles afar
To go down by the river o' Joe
But the locals still speak of the endless rain
The revenge of the muddy tides again
To the developers who would bring change
Down by the river o' Joe
