Sante Anno gained the day
<i>Away... Sante Anno</i>
Sante Anno gained the day
 <i>All on the plains of Mexico</i>
 <i>
 So heave her up and away we’ll go
 Heave away Sante Anno
 Heave her up and away we’ll go
 All on the plains of Mexico
 </i>
He gained the day at Molley-Del-Rey
An’ General Taylor ran away.

All of his men were brave &amp; true,
Every soldier brave and true.

Oh, Sante Anno fought for fame,
Oh, Sante Anno gained a name.

An’ Zacharias Taylor ran away,
He ran away at Molley-Del-Rey.

Sante Anno’s men were brave,
Many found a soldier’s grave.

`Twas a fierce &amp; bitter strife,
Hand to hand they fought for life.

An’ Sante Anno’s name is known,
What a man can do was shown.

Oh, Sante Anno fought for his gold,
What deeds he did have oft been told.

`twas on the field of Molley-Del-Rey,
Sante Anno lost a leg that day.

Oh, Sante Anno’s day is o’er,
Sante Anno will fight no more.

Oh, Sante Anno’s gone away,
Far from the field of Molley-Del-Rey.

Oh, Sante Anno now we mourn,
We left him buried off Cape Horn.
