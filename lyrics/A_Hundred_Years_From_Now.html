If you ever see a hearse go by,
Do you ever think you're going to die?
<i>
OOH OOH OOH OOH where will you be,
Where will you be in a hundred years from now?
</i>
They wrap you up in a crisp white sheet,
And tuck in the corners all nice and neat.
<i>
OOH OOH OOH OOH where will you be,
Where will you be in a hundred years from now?
</i>
They put you into a wooden box,
And cover you over with earth and rocks.
<i>
OOH OOH OOH OOH where will you be,
Where will you be in a hundred years from now?
</i>
The worms crawl in and the worms crawl out,
They crawl in thin and they crawl out stout.
<i>
OOH OOH OOH OOH where will you be,
Where will you be in a hundred years from now?
</i>
Your teeth fall in and your eyes pop out,
Your brains come trickling down your snout.
<i>
OOH OOH OOH OOH where will you be,
Where will you be in a hundred years from now?
</i>

OOH OOH OOH OOH where will you be,
Where will you be in a hundred years from now?

DEAD!!!!!!!!!  D...e...a....d.   Ha, ha, ha, ha!   Dead.
