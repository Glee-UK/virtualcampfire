 A Hundred Years From Now

If you ever see a hearse go by,
Do you ever think you're going to die?

OOH OOH OOH OOH where will you be,
Where will you be in a hundred years from now?
OOH OOH OOH OOH where will you be,
Where will you be in a hundred years from now?

They wrap you up in a crisp white sheet,
And tuck in the corners all nice and neat.
They put you into a wooden box,
And cover you over with earth and rocks.
The worms crawl in and the worms crawl out,
They crawl in thin and they crawl out stout,
Your teeth fall in and your eyes pop out,
Your brains come trickling down your snout

OOH OOH OOH OOH where will you be,
Where will you be in a hundred years from now?
OOH OOH OOH OOH where will you be,
Where will you be in a hundred years from now?

DEAD!!!!!!!!!  D...e...a....d.   Ha, ha, ha, ha!   Dead.

OOH OOH OOH OOH where will you be,
Where will you be in a hundred years from now?
OOH OOH OOH OOH where will you be,
Where will you be in a hundred years from now?

DEAD!!!!!!!!!  D...e...a....d.   Ha, ha, ha, ha!   Dead.
