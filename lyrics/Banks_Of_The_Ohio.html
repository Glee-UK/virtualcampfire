<pre>
I asked my love to take a walk
To take a walk, just a little walk
Down beside where the waters flow
Down by the banks of the Ohio
<i>
 And only say that you’ll be mine
 And in no other’s arms entwine
 Down beside where the waters flow
 Down by the banks of the Ohio
</i>
I held a knife against her breast
As close into my arms she pressed
She cried, “Oh Willie, don’t you murder me
I’m not prepared for eternity!”

I took her by the lily white hand
And led her down by the water’s strand
I picked her up and pitched her in
And watched her body floating by

I wandered home ‘twixt twelve and one,
I cried, “My God, what have I done?
I’ve killed the only woman I loved,
Because she would not be my bride.”
