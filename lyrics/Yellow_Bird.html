 <i>
 Yellow bird up high in banana tree
 Yellow bird you sit all alone like me
 Did your lady friend leave the nest again?
 That is very sad, makes me feel so bad
 You can fly away in the sky away
 You more lucky than me
 </i>
I also have a pretty girl
She not with me today
They’re all the same the pretty girls
Make them the nest then they fly away

Wish that I was a yellow bird
I’d fly away with you
But I’m not a yellow bird
So here I sit, nothing else to do
