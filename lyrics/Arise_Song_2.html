<pre>
Awake, awake, the sun is on the hill
The dew is on the grass and you are lying still
Arise, arise for every shadow flies
The morn is in the forests and the dew-washed skies
With the sun awake now
Stir yourself and shake now
Song in every break now
Call you back to life
Awake! Awake! The sun is on the hill
The dew is on the grass and you are lying still
