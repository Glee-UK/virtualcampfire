 Wild Mountain Thyme

<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>
The Summertime has come
And the trees are sweetly blooming
And the wild mountain thyme
Grows around the blooming heather
 <i>
Will ye go, lassie, go?
And we’ll all go together
To pull wild mountain thyme
All around the blooming heather
Will ye go, lassie, go?
 </i>
I will build my love a bower
By yon clear crystal fountain
And on it I will plant
All the flowers of the mountain

And if my true love she won’t come
I will surely
find another
To pull wild mountain thyme
All around the blooming heather

I will build my love a shelter
On yon high mountain green
And my love shall be fairest
That the summer sun has seen

And we’ll all go together
To pull wild mountain thyme
All around the blooming heather
Will ye go, lassie, go?
