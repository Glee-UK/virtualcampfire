  Cockles And Mussels

<pre>
In Dublin’s fair city where the girls are so pretty
I first set my eyes on sweet Molly Malone
As she wheeled her wheelbarrow
Through streets broad and narrow
<i>
 Crying Cockles and Mussels, alive alive oh!
 Alive alive oh, alive alive oh,
 Crying Cockles and Mussels, alive alive oh!
</i>
She was a fishmonger, but sure ‘twas no wonder
For so were her Father and Mother before
And they each wheeled their barrow
Through streets broad and narrow

She died of a fever and no one could save her
And that was the end of sweet Molly Malone
Now her ghost wheels her barrow
Through streets broad and narrow
