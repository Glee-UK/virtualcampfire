  Mingulay Boat Song

<pre>
What care we though white the Minch is
What care we for wind or weather
Let her go, boys! Every inch is
Weaving home, home to Mingulay
 <i>
 Heel yer ho, boys, let her go, boys
 Bring her head round, now all together
 Heel yer ho, boys, let her go, boys
 Sailing home, home to Mingulay
 </i>
Wives are waiting on the bank, or
Looking seaward from the heather
Pull her round, boys! And weâ€™ll anchor
Ere the sun set at Mingulay
