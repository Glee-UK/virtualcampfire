Bring out the skillet, slip on the lid,
Mama's gonna make a little shortnin' bread.
That ain't all she's gonna do,
Mama's gonna make a little coffee, too.
<i>
Mama's little baby loves shortnin', shortnin',
Mama's little baby loves shortnin' bread,
Mama's little baby loves shortnin', shortnin',
Mama's little baby loves shortnin' bread.

Three little children, lying in bed
Two were sick and the other were dead
Sent for the doctor and the doctor said,
"Feed those children on shortnin' bread."
<i>
Mama's little baby loves shortnin', shortnin',
Mama's little baby loves shortnin' bread,
Mama's little baby loves shortnin', shortnin',
Mama's little baby loves shortnin' bread.
</i>
Store the skillet, store the lid,
Store people gonna make shortnin' bread;
Three dollars for the skillet, three dollars for the lid,
Three months in jail eating shortnin' bread.
<i>
Mama's little baby loves shortnin', shortnin',
Mama's little baby loves shortnin' bread,
Mama's little baby loves shortnin', shortnin',
Mama's little baby loves shortnin' bread.
