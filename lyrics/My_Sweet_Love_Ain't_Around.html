Listen to that rain a-fallin'
Can't you hear that lonesome sound
Oh, my poor heart is breaking
'Cause my sweet love ain't round

Memories come back to haunt me
My dream house has done fell down
This old world is dark around me
'Cause my sweet love ain't around

Lord, I think I'll start to ramble
Got to leave this weary town
This old place is way too lonely
'Cause my sweet love ain't around

On that train tonight I'm leaving
And I don't know where I'm bound
I can't stay here any longer
'Cause my sweet love ain't around

I can't stay here any longer
'Cause my sweet love ain't around
'Cause my sweet love ain't around
