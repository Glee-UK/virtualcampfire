 Handsome John Brown

<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>
Seven locks upon a red gate
Seven gates about the red town
In the town there is a butcher...
And his name is handsome John Brown
 (In the town there is a butcher and his name is handsome John Brown)

John Browns’ spurs, they jingle and ring
John Browns’ boots are polished so fine
On his coat a single flower...
In his hand a glass of red wine
 (On his coat a single flower in his hand a glass of red
wine)

In the night, the silver spurs ring
In the dark, the polished boots shine
Don’t come tapping at my window...
If your heart no longer is mine
 (Don’t come tapping at my window if your heart no
longer is mine)
