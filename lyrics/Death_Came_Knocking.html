 Death Came Knocking

<pre>
You know that death came a-knockin’ on my mother’s door
Singin’ “Come on, mother, ain’t ya ready to go?”
And my mother stooped down, buckled up her shoes
And she moved on down by the Jordan stream
And then she shout
“Hallelujah! Done, done my duty!
Got on my travelin’ shoes”
