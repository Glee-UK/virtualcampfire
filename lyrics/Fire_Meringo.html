Lift him up and carry him along
Fire Meringo, fire away
 
Stow him below where he belongs
Fire Meringo, fire away
 
Ease him down and let him lay
Fire Meringo, fire away

Screw him in and there he'll stay
Fire Meringo, fire away

Put him in his hole below
Fire Meringo, fire away

Stay he must and then he'll go
Fire Meringo, fire away

When I get back to Liverpool town
Fire Meringo, fire away

I'll pull a line to little Sally Brown
Fire Meringo, fire away

I'll haul her high, I'll haul her low
Fire Meringo, fire away
 
I'll bust her blocks and make her go
Fire Meringo, fire away
 
Sally is a pretty little craft
Fire Meringo, fire away
 
Hot shot to the fore and rounded in the aft
Fire Meringo, fire away
 
Screw that cotton, screw him down
Fire Meringo, fire away

Let's get the hell back to Liverpool town
Fire Meringo, fire away
