 Lady And The Crocodile
</h1>
<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>
She sailed away on a sunny summer’s day
On the back of a crocodile
You see, said she, He’s as tame as tame can be
I’ll ride him down the Nile
Well the croc winked his eye
As the lady waved goodbye
Wearing a happy smile
But at the end of the ride
The lady was inside
And the smile was on the crocodile
