Go away from my window
Leave at your own chosen speed
I'm not the one you want, babe
I'm not the one you need
You say you're looking for someone
Who's never weak but always strong
To protect you and defend you
Whether you are right or wrong
Someone to open each and every door
<i>
But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you're looking for, babe
</i>
Go lightly from the ledge, babe
Go lightly on the ground
I'm not the one you want, babe
I will only let you down
You say you're looking for someone
Who will promise never to part
Someone to close his eyes for you
Someone to close his heart
Someone who will die for you and more
<i>
But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you're looking for, babe
</i>
Go melt back in to the night
Everything inside is made of stone
There's nothing in here moving
And anyway I'm not alone
You say you're looking for someone
Who'll pick you up each time you fall
To gather flowers constantly
And to come each time you call
A lover for your life and nothing more
<i>
But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you're looking for, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you're looking for
