<pre>
It was homeward bound one night on the deep
Swinging in my hammock I fell asleep
I dreamed a dream and I thought it true
Concerning Franklin and his gallant crew

With one hundred seamen they sailed away
To the frozen ocean in the month of May
To seek a passage around the pole
Alas poor seamen do sometimes do

Through cruel hardships they mainly strove
Their ship on mountains of ice was drove
Only the Eskimo in his skin canoe
He was the only one who ever came through

In Baffin's Bay where the whale fish blow
The fate of Franklin no man may know
The fate of Franklin no tongue can tell
Lord Franklin along with his sailors do dwell

And now my burden it gives me pain
For my long lost Franklin I'd cross the main
Ten thousand pounds I would freely give
To know on earth that Lord Franklin do live
