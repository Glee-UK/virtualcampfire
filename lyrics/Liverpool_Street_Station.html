Liverpool Street Station

<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>
The girl that I love
has given me the shove
She says I am too low for her station

She says poor men are fools
Over rich men, she drools
So it's rob a bank, or take up the pools

I cannot sleep, life goes on and on
I've started taking Mogadon
But love's a sickness, doctors can't treat

Where does she go?
Where does she live?
Her place of work to me, she didn't ever give
And now, I find I miss the love she takes, but won't deliver
