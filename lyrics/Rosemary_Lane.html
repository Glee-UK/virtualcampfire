When I was in service in the Rosemary Lane
I won the goodwill of my master of the day
‘Til a sailor came there, one night to lay
And that was the beginning of my misery

He called for a candle to light him to bed
And likewise a silk handkerchief to tie up his head
To tie up his head, as sailors will do
And then said, “My pretty Polly, will you come too?”

Now this maid being young and foolish she thought it no harm
For to lie into bed to keep herself warm
And what was done there I will never disclose
But I wish that short night had been seven long years

Next morning the sailor so early arose
And into my apron three guineas did throw
Saying,This I will give, and more I will do
If you’ll be my Polly wherever I’ll go

Now if it’s a boy he shall fight for the King
And if it’s a girl she will wear a gold ring
She will wear a gold ring and a dress all aflame
And remember my service in Rosemary Lane

When I was in service in the Rosemary Lane
I won the goodwill of my master of the day
‘Til a sailor came there, one night to lay
And that was the beginning of my misery
