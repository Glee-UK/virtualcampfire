<pre>
I got an old mule and her name is Sal
Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal
She’s a good worker and a good old pal
Fifteen years on the Erie Canal
We’ve hauled some barges in our day
Full of lumber and coal and hay
And we know every inch of the way
From Albany to Buffalo
<i>
 Low bridge, everybody down
 Low bridge for we’re coming to a town
 And you’ll always know your neighbour
 You’ll always know your pal
 If you’ve ever navigated on the Erie Canal
 </i>
We’d better get along on our way old gal
Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal
‘Cause you bet your life I’d never part with Sal
Fifteen years on the Erie Canal

Get up there, mule, here comes a lock
We’ll make Rome ‘bout six o’clock
One more trip and back we go
Right back home to Buffalo
