The Keeper did a-shooting go
And under his cloak he carries a bow
All for to shoot at a merry little doe
Among the leaves so green-o

Jackie Boy             Master
Sing ye well           Very Well
Hey down               Ho down
Derry, derry down. Among the leaves so green-o

To my hey down down    To my ho down down
Hey down               Ho down
Derry, derry down. Among the leaves so green-o

The first doe he shot at he missed
The second doe went where nobody wist
The third dow went where nobody wist
Among the leaves so green-o

The fourth doe she did cross the brook
The keeper fetched her back with his crook
Where she is now she may remain
Among the leaves so green-o

The fifth doe she did cross the brook
the keeper fetched her back with his crook
Where she is now you may go and look
Among the leaves so green-o

The sixth doe she ran over the plain
But he with his hounds did turn her again
It is there he did hunt in a merry, merry vein
Among the leaves so green-o
