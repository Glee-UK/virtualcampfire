<pre>
Tumble outta bed and stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
Yawnin' and stretchin' and try to come to life
Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin'
Out on the streets, the traffic starts jumpin'
With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5
<i>
     Working 9 to 5, what a way to make a living
     Barely gettin' by, it's all taking and no giving
     They just use your mind and they never give you credit
     It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
     9 to 5, for service and devotion
     You would think that I would deserve a fair promotion
     Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me
     I swear sometimes that man is out to get me Mmmmm...
</i>
They let you dream just to watch them shatter
You're just a step on the boss man's ladder
But you got dreams he'll never take away
In the same boat with a lot of your friends
Waiting for the day your ship will come in
And the tide's gonna turn an' it's all gonna roll you away
