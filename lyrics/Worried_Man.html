 It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
 It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
 It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
 I’m worried now but I won’t be worried long
 </i>

I swam across the river and laid me down to sleep...
When I woke, there were shackles on my feet

Shackles on my feet and twenty one links of chain...
And every one initialled with my name

I asked the judge, “What’s gonna be my fine?”...
Twenty-one years on the Rocky Mountain Line

The train I ride is twenty-one coaches long...
I’m worried now, but I won’t be worried long
