 Broadside to Broadside
</h1>
<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>
Keep your land you gentry of England, France and Spain
For there’s nothing like dominion of the water
From the rocky coast of Kerry to the bloody Spanish Main
It’s the best thing you can ever teach your daughter
<i>
Broadside to broadside, two captains collide
Queen of the spheres and queen of the tide
Regalia and rebellion go sailing side by side
Haul away, sister, haul away
</i>
Plunder men for treasure, and never heed their blows
For there’s nothing given freely to a woman
Be generous to friendship and lavish to your foes
Then pirate queens may share the seas in common

For blows will make you weary and marriage make a slave
You’d be better on the sea like brave O’Malley
And when that gallant vessel goes a rolling on the wave
Be sure you’re on the deck not in the galley
