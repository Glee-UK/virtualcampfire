Three Crows

<pre>
Three crows sat upon a wall
Sat upon a wall
Sat upon a wall
Three crows sat upon a wall
On a cold and frosty morning

The first crow was greeting for his ma
Was greeting for his ma
Was greeting for his ma
The first crow was greeting for his ma
On a cold and frosty morning

The second crow fell down and broke his jaw
fell down and broke his jaw
fell down and broke his jaw
The second crow fell down and broke his jaw
On a cold and frosty morning

The third crow he could na flee at all
he could na flee at all
he could na flee at all
The third crow he could na flee at all
On a cold and frosty morning

The fourth crow he was nay there at all
