<h1>
 The Leaving of Liverpool
</h1>
<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>
Farewell to you my own true love
I’m going far away
I am bound for California
But I know that I’ll return some day
 <i>
 So fare thee well my own true love
 And when I return united we will be
 It’s not the leaving of Liverpool that grieves me
 But my darling when I think of thee
 </i>
I have shipped on a Yankee sailing ship
Davy Crockett is her name
And Burgess is the Captain of her
And they say she’s a floating shame

I have shipped with Burgess once before
And I think I know him well
If a man is a sailor he can get along
If he’s not then he’s sure in hell

Oh the sun is on the harbour, love
And I wish I could remain
For I know it will be some long time
Before I see you again
