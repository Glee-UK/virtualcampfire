Did you hear the story about Cocaine Lil?
She had a cocaine house on Cocaine Hill
She had a cocaine dog and a cocaine cat
She even had a cocaine rat
And it's all running around my brain
Cocaine running around my brain

Been walking round Tenth Street and Main
I've been looking for a girl now to give me cocaine
Cocaine's sure running round my brain
I've been walking round Tenth Street and Main
I've been looking for somebody supplying cocaine
Cocaine's sure running round my brain

Now Cocaine Lil and Morphine Sue
They've been strolling down the avenue two by two
Said Lil to Sue, "It's gonna do no harm
If we both have a little old shot in the arm"
And it's all running round my brain,
Cocaine's running round my brain

Well the doctor tells me again and again
He says "Cocaine's for horses it ain't for men"
Cocaine's sure running round my brain
I've been walking round Tenth Street and Main
I've been looking for someone to give me cocaine
Cocaine's sure running round my brain

Well I've been to the East and I've been to the West
I've had it with the worst I've done it with the best
I've been to the North and I've been to South
I've had it in my nose and I've done it in my mouth
Cocaine running around my brain
Cocaine is running round my brain

Here's my baby dressed in red
Aww you know I didn't mean it
Won't you come to bed
Cocaine's sure running around my brain
Here's my baby dressed in green
Don't you know she's my ever loving sex machine
Cocaine's sure running around my brain

Well I went to the doctor the very next day
To see what kinda words he had to say
He said the cocaine habit is very bad
It's killed my mama and nearly killed my dad
Cocaine's sure running around my brain
Cocaine's running around my brain

I went to the drugstore painted red
And sign on the window said we're all dead
Cocaine's sure running round my brain

I went to a drug store painted blue
And the sign on the window said we're dead too
Cocaine's travelling round my brain

I went down to Messalita on a hope
The sign on the window said no more dope
I woke up this morning beneath the courthouse bell
All those cocaine girls giving me cocaine hell
Cocaine's sure running round my brain
Cocaine's running round my brain

Here's my baby dressed in white
Aww you know I didn't mean it
You're up all night
Cocaine's sure running round my brain
Here's my baby dressed in black
Don't you know she's being doing that good old crack
Cocaine's sure running round my brain

Yeah that's the story about Cocaine Lil
She had a cocaine house on Cocaine Hill
She had a cocaine dog and a cocaine cat
She even had a cocaine hat sitting on her head
Now the poor girl's dead
