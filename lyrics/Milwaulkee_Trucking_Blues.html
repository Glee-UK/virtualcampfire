 Milwaulkee Truckin' Blues
</h1>
<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>
Drink your whiskey, drink your rye
Turn your thoughts up to the sky
Things will happen by and by
If you keep on truckin' along
 <i>
 Truckin', truckin', truckin'
 Truckin', truckin', truckin'
 Truckin', truckin', truckin'
 Keep truckin', keep on truckin'
 </i>
Drink your whiskey, drink your wine
Everything’s gonna turn out fine
You do your thing and I’ll do mine
And we’ll keep on truckin’ along

Drink your whiskey, drink your booze
Some you win and some you loose
We’ve got them ol’ Milwaulkee blues
But we’ll keep on truckin' along
