<pre>
On a summer’s day, in the month of May
A burly bum came hiking
Down a shady lane with a sugar cane
He was looking for his liking
As he strolled along, he sang a song
Of the land of milk and honey
Where a bum can stay for many a day
And he don’t need any money
 <i>
 Oh the... Buzzin’ of the bees in the cigarette trees
 The soda-water fountains
 Where the lemonade springs, and the blue bird sings
 In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
 </i>
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
You never wash your socks
And little streams of alcohol
Come trickling down the rocks

There’s a lake of stew and whisky too
And you paddle around in a big canoe
Where they hung the jerk who invented work
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains

In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
The cops have wooden legs
The bulldogs all have rubber teeth
And the hens lay soft-boiled eggs

The farmers’ trees are full of fruit, the barns are full of hay
I want to go where there ain’t no snow
Where the rain don’t fall and the wind don’t blow
In the Big Rock Candy Mountains
