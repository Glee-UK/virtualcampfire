<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>
She sat 'neath the lilacs and played her guitar
Played her guitar, played her guitar
She sat under the lilacs and played her guitar
Played her guitar-ha-ha-ha

He sat down beside her and smoked his cigar
Smoked his cigar, smoked his cigar
He sat down beside her and smoked his cigar
Smoked his cigar-ha-ha-ha

He said that he loved her, but oh, how he lied...

She said she believed him, but oh, how she sighed...

They were to be married, but somehow she died...

He went to her funeral but just for the ride...

He sat on her tombstone and laughed till he cried...

The tombstone fell on him and squish-squash, he died...

The parson was passing and popped him inside...

She went to heaven and flip-flap she flied...

He went to t’other place and frizzled and fried...

The devils they ate him with pitchforks and knives...

The moral of this story is don’t tell a lie
