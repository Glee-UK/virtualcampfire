I like the flowers and I like the trees
I like the woodlands and the bees
I like the Byrds on their LPs
And I’m a refug-e-e
 <i>
 I wanna be a mole in a hole, digging low and slow
 I wanna be a fly flying high in the sky
 I wanna be a mole in a hole, digging low and slow
 I wanna be a fly flying high in the sky
 </i>
I had a friend as wise as Mr Wise Owl
He could count from one to ten, from A to Z
My friend he was so wise he got religion
That’s why I’m alive today and he is dead
I had a friend who had a friend in Jesus
He used to read the good book every day
My friend he got so friendly with friend Jesus
Friend Jesus took my only friend away
My feet are smelly and my hair’s a mess
My teeth are yellow and I’ve got bad breath
I may look great but I feel like death
And I’m a refugee
