 Green Grow The Rushes O

I’ll sing you one-o!
Green grow the rushes-o
What is your one-o?
One is one and all alone
And ever more shall be so

I’ll sing you two-o!
Green grow the rushes-o
What is your two-o?
Two, two, the lily white boys clothéd all in green-o
One is one and all alone
And ever more shall be so

I’ll sing you three-o!
Green grow the rushes-o
What is your three-o?
Three, three the rivals
Two, two, the lily white boys clothéd all in green-o
One is one and all alone
And ever more shall be so

Four for the Gospel makers

Five for the symbols at your door

Six for the six proud walkers

Seven for the seven stars in the sky

Eight for the April rainers

Nine for the nine bright shiners

Ten for the ten commandments

Eleven for the eleven that went to heaven

Twelve for the twelve apostles
