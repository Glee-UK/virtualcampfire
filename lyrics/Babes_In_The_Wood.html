 Babes in the Wood

O, don’t you remember a long time ago
Those two little babies their names I don’t know,
They strayed far away one bright summer’s day,
Those two little babies got lost on their way.

<i>
 Pretty babes in the wood, pretty babes in the wood,
 O, don’t you remember those babes in the wood?
</i>

Now the day being done and the night coming on
Those two little babies sat under a stone.
They sobbed and they sighed they sat down and cried,
Those two little babies they lay down and died.

Now the robins so red so swiftly they sped,
They put out their wide wings and over them spread.
And all the day long the branches they throng,
They sweetly did carol and this was their song.
