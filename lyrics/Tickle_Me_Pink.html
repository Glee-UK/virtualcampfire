  Tickle Me Pink

<pre>
Tickle me Pink, I’m rosy as a flushed red apple skin
Except I’ve never been as sweet
 rolled around the orchard
And found myself too awkward
And tickle me green I’m too naive
 <i>
 Pray for the people inside your head
 For they won’t be there when you’re dead
 Muffled out and pushed back down
 Pushed back to the leafy ground
 </i>
Time is too early, my hair it isn’t curly
I wish I was home and tucked away
When nothing goes right
And the future’s dark as night

What we need is a sunny, sunny day
Don’t know where I can buy myself a brand new pair of ears
Don’t know where I can buy a heart
The one I’ve got is shoddy

I need a brand new body
And then I can have a brand new start
Monsters in the valley and shootings in the ally
And people fall flat at every turn

There is no straight and narrow
Offload your wheel-barrow
And pick up your sticks and twigs to burn
