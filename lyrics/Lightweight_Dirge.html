<pre>
 Our master of old has now passed awa
 At peace and at rest, we may all see him lay
 We've one consolation now we are unmastered
 Until his last breath, he was a real bastard
<i>
 Every man had a good word for he
 But will not repeat it in company
</i>
 His life it was long which made ours seem longer
 When we fed him hemlock that just made him stronger
 When we cut off his beard and set frie fo his stubble
 He untied our cottages and reduced them to rubble

 He was fond of animals, especially of horses
 So we pulled the plough, while he went to race courses
 He also loved children and tried without cease
 By night and by day to make their numbers increase

 On his common land we had grazing rights
 But you don't get fat eating grass every night
 He gave us each year a long holiday
 Which started in winter without any pay

 Now he is gone, his life is complete
 We have placed a large stone at his head and his feet
 The stones are all prepared, indeed truth to tell
 It was them falling on him that sent him to hell
