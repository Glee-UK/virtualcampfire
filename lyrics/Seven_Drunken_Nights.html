 Seven Drunken Nights
</h1>
<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>
As I went home on a Monday night
 <i>As drunk as drunk could be</i>
I saw a horse outside the door
Where my old horse should be
 <i>Well I calls me wife and I says to her
 Would you kindly tell to me</i>
Who owns that horse outside my house
Where my old horse should be?
 <i>
 Well you’re drunk, you’re drunk, you silly old fool
 Until you cannot see
 </i>
That is a lovely sow that my mother sent to me
 <i>Well it’s many a day I’ve travelled
 A hundred miles or more</i>
But a saddle on a sow sure I never saw before

As I went home on a Tuesday night...
I saw a coat behind the door
Where my old coat should be...
...That is a lovely blanket that my mother sent to me...
...But buttons on a blanket sure I never saw before

As I went home on a Wednesday night...
I saw a pipe upon the chair
Where my old pipe should be...
...That is a lovely tin whistle that my mother sent to me...
...But tobacco in a tin whistle sure I never saw before

As I went home on a Thursday night ...
I saw two boots beneath the bed
Where my old boots should be...
...They are two geranium pots that my mother sent to me...
...But laces in geranium pots I never saw before

As I went home on a Friday night...
I saw a head inside the bed
Where my old head should be...
...That is a baby boy that my mother sent to me...
...But a baby boy with his whiskers on sure I never saw before

As I went home on Saturday night...
I saw a hand upon her breast
Where my old hand should be...
...That is a lovely nightgown that my mother sent to me...
... But a nightgown with fingers sure I never saw before

As I went home on a Sunday night...
I saw a thing between her legs
Where my old thing should be...
...That is a lovely shillelagh that my mother sent to me...
...But testicles on a shillelagh sure I never saw before
