 My Johnny Was A Shoemaker

<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>
My Johnny was a shoemaker
And dearly he loved me
My Johnny was a shoemaker
But now he’s gone to sea
With pitch and tar to soil his hands
And to sail across the sea, stormy sea
And sail across the stormy sea

His jacket was a deep sky blue
And curly was his hair
His jacket was a deep sky blue
It was I do declare
For to reef the topsails up against the mast
And to sail across the sea, stormy sea

And sail across the stormy sea
Some day he’ll be a captain bold
With a brave and gallant crew
Some day he’ll be a captain bold
With a sword and spyglass too
And when he has his gallant captain’s sword
He’ll come home and marry me, marry me
He’ll come home and marry me
