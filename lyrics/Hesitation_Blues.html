 Hesitation Blues
</h1>
<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>
If the river was whisky and I was a duck
I’d dive to the bottom and I’d never come up
 <i>
 Tell me how long have I got to wait?
 Can I get you now, or must I... Hesitate?
 </i>
If the river was whisky and the branch was vine
You’d see me in bed most all of the time

I was born in Alabama, raised in Tennessee
You don’t like my peaches, don’t you shake my tree

Two old maids sitting in the sand
Each one a-wishing that the other was a man

I was born in England, schooled in France
If you want to know more best ask my parents

I’m standing on the corner with a dollar in my hand
Looking for a woman who’s looking for a man

I got the hesitation stockings, hesitation shoes
I really do believe I’ve got the hesitation blues
