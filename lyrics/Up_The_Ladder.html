 <i>
 It’s up the ladder rung by rung
 Passing other climbers one by one
 And when you reach for the top make no mistakes
 It’s up the ladders and down the snakes
 </i>
The dice is cast, you’re the lowest of the low
At the bottom of the ladder with a long way to go
You climb on board put your trotters on the tread
You can see where you’re going and it’s clear up ahead

You’re a fighter, you’re a climber, you’re a fella with a quest
Overtaking all the others who are stopping for a rest
And then you glance down the ladder at the ones you’ve passed
And you spot another climber and he’s catching up fast

You put your time in, you’re climbing though you can’t remember why
And your arms keep moving and you wish that you could fly
And looking down from the ladder is the fella you must shift
He’s arrived with a friend with a private lift

Now your legs are getting weary but the top is just avay
But your step are getting bigger and the ladder starts to sway
You’re looking forward to a rest but when you make it to the top
It’s the bottom of a ladder and they won’t let you stop
