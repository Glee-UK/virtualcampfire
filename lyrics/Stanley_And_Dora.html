<pre>
Stanley and Dora was lovers
They met down the Tottenham Court Road
A whoopin’ it up at the Palais
Where the ice cream fountains flowed
 <i>
He was her man, a Lonny Donegan fan
 </i>
Now Dora worked at the Dominion
The best usherette in the flicks
She sold Stan a ticket for one and nine
Wot did oughta cost four and six
He left his cosh in his mackintosh

Well Dora was swiftly promoted
To the circle she rose in a dream
When who should she see but young Stanley
Wiv the chick wot sold ice-cream
He’d chucked her up for a Walls’ Ice Cup

But justice came soon to poor Dora
For Stan and his Walls’ ice cream
They both was killed in the rush for the exit
When they played God Save the Queen
God save our Stan, the only one wot can
