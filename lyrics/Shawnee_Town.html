 Shawnee Town

<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>
Well some rows up, but we floats down
Way down the Ohio to Shawneetown
 <i>
 And it’s hard on the beach oar, she moves too slow
 Way down to Shawneetown on the Ohio
 </i>
Now the current’s got her, and we’ll take up the slack
We’ll float her down to Shawneetown
And we’ll bushwack her back

Whisky’s in the jar, boys, the wheat is in the sack
We’ll trade ‘em down to Shawneetown
And we’ll bring the rock salt back

I’ve got a wife in Louisville and one in New Orleans
When I get to Shawneetown
Gonna see my Indian queen

Water’s mighty warm, boys, the air is cold and dank
And that cursed fog
It gets so thick you cannot see the bank

Well some rows up, but we floats down
Way down the Ohio to Shawneetown
