<pre>
In a cavern, in a canyon
Excavating for a mine
Dwelt a miner, forty-niner
And his daughter Clementine
 <i>
 Oh my darling, Oh my darling,
 Oh my darling Clementine
 You are lost and gone forever
 Dreadful sorry, Clementine
 </i>
Light she was and like a fairy
And her shoes were number nine
Herring boxes without topses
Sandals were for Clementine

Drove she ducklings to the water
Every morning just at nine
Stubbed her toe against a splinter
Fell into the foaming brine

Ruby lips above the water
Blowing bubbles soft and fine
But alas! I was no swimmer
So I lost my Clementine

In a churchyard near the canyon
Where the myrtle doth entwine
There grow roses and other posies
Fertilized by Clementine

Then the miner, forty-niner
Soon began to peak and pine
Thought he oughta join his daughter
Now he’s with his Clementine

In my dreams she still doth haunt me
Robed in garments soaked with brine
Though in life I used to hug her
Now she’s dead I draw the line

Now ye Boy Scouts, heed the warning
To this tragic tale of mine
Artificial respiration
Would have saved my Clementine

How I missed her, how I missed her
How I missed my Clementine
‘Til I kissed her little sister
And forgot my Clementine
