In South Australia I was born
<i> Heave away, haul away</i>
In South Australia ‘round Cape Horn
 <i>We’re bound for South Australia</i>
<i>
 Haul away, you rolling kings
 Heave away, haul away
 Haul away, oh hear me sing
 We’re bound for South Australia
</i>
As I walked out one morning fair...
‘Twas there I met Miss Nancy Blair...

I rolled her up, I rolled her down...
I rolled her round and round the town...

There ain’t but one thing grieves my mind...
To leave Miss Nancy Blair behind...

And as we wallop around Cape Horn...
You’ll wish to God you’d never been born...

Now here I am in a foreign land...
With a bottle of whisky in me hand...

Port Adelaide is a fine old town...
There’s plenty of girls to go around...
