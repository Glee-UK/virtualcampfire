 <i>
 I like to rise when the sun she rises
 Early in the morning
 And I like to hear them small birds singing
 Merrily upon their layland
 And hurrah for the life of a country boy
 And to ramble in the new mown hay
 </i>
In spring we sow, at the harvest mow
And that is how the seasons round they go
Oh but of all the times choose I may
‘Twould be rambling in the new mown hay

In summer when the sun is hot
We sing, we dance, and we drink a lot
We spend all night in sport and play
And go rambling in the new mown hay

In autumn when the oak trees turn
We gather all the wood that’s fit to burn
We cut and stash and stow away
And go rambling in the new mown hay

In winter when the sky turns grey
We hedge and we ditch our lives away
But in the summer when the sun shines gay
We go rambling in the new-mown hay

Oh Nancy is my darling gay
And she blooms like the flowers every day
But I love her best in the month of May
When we’re rambling in the new mown hay
