 Hares on the Mountain

Oh Sally, my dear, it’s you I’d be kissing,
Oh Sally, my dear, it’s you I’d be kissing,
She smiled and replied, you don’t know what you’re missing.

Oh Sally, my dear, I wish I could wed you,
She smiled and replied, then you’d say I’d misled you.

If all you young men were hares on the mountain,
How many young girls would take guns and go hunting?

If the young men could sing like blackbirds and thrushes,
How many young girls would go beating the bushes?

If all you young men were ducks in the water,
How many young girls would soon go swim after?

If all you young men were rushes a-growing,
How many young girls would take scythes and go mowing?

But the young men are given to frisking and fooling,
Oh, the young men are given to frisking and fooling,
So I’ll leave them alone and attend to my schooling
