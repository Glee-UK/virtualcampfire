<h1>
 Let Them Stay
</h1>
<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>
We brought them into our homes and into our lives,
You said we’re doing right for those who’ve survived.
You said give them family, you said give them love,
Give them hope for a future not strewn by blood

<i>
Yet the day they come of age
You say we can’t have them stay
</i>

We gave them a home, we gave them our care
We grew to love them, to ease their despair
You said we were family, to see them as so
But now you say it’s not so when they grow

<i>
For the day they come of age
You say we can’t have them stay
</i>

They’ve suffered so much from all they have seen
Torture, death and destruction, often obscene.
They lost their home and country, all that they knew
From soldiers who cared not the family they slew

<i>
But the day they come of age
You say we can’t have them stay
</i>

We sent them to school in a language unknown.
They coped with the system, survived and have grown
They want the same as their peers, are doing their best,
Just let them have the same rights. Give it a rest!

<i>
So the day they come of age
We say we CAN have them stay!
So the day they come of age
We say we CAN have them stay!
