Once I Lived In Old Virginia

<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>
Once I lived in old Virginia
To North Carolina I did go
There I spied a beautiful damsel
But her name I never did know

Her hair was black as any charcoal
Her eyes were of some diamond blue
On her bosom she wore white lilies
Well My poor heart 'most broke in two

Every day I am thinking about her
Every night so that I can't rest
Every moment seems like an hour
Oh what a pain across my breast

Fetch me a razor and a pan of cold water
Fetch me a hammer to beat out my brains
For the old corn liquor has got me surrounded
And the women have run me deranged

Shall I go to Alligaty
Well shall I go for loving you
Or shall I go to some far country
Where I may bid a sad adieu
