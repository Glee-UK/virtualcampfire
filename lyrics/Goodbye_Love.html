<h1>
 Goodbye Love
</h1>
<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>
I don't know, I don't know
Just where to go or what to do
It makes no difference
What I do without you

Oh, I love you, my darling
And I'll try and to leave you be
Goodbye, is the last
You'll hear of me

Well, I found a bluebird
High on a mountain side
And the little bird
Would sing this little song
So I sigh, I'll cry
I'd even wanna die
For the one that I love has gone
