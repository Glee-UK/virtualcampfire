When I was a little lad or so my mother told me
 <i>Way haul away, we’ll haul away Joe</i>
That if I didn’t kiss the girls my lips would grow all mouldy
 <i>Way haul away, we’ll haul away Joe</i>
 <i>
 Way haul away, we’ll haul away together
 Way haul away, we’ll haul away, Joe
 Way haul away, we’ll haul for better weather
 Way haul away, we’ll haul away, Joe
 </i>
King Louis was the king of France, before the revolution...
And then he had his head cut off which spoiled his constitution...

The cook is in the galley making duff so handy...
The captain’s in his cabin drinking wine and brandy...

You call yourself a second mate but you cannot tie a bowline...
You cannot even stand up straight when the ship it is a-rolling...

Once I was in Ireland a’digging turf and taties...
But now I’m on a Yankee ship a’hauling on the braces...

St Patrick was a gentleman, he came of decent people...
He built a church in Dublin town and on it put a steeple...

Charley Dalton had a pig and it was double-jointed...
He took it to the blacksmith’s shop to get its trotters pointed...

St. Patrick drove away the snakes, then drank up all the whiskey...
This made him sing and dance a jig, he felt so fine and frisky...
