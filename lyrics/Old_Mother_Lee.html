<pre>
There was an old woman called Old Mother Lee
 <i>Old Mother Lee, Old Mother Lee</i>
There was an old woman called Old Mother Lee
 <i>
 Down by the walnut tree
 Down by the sea
 Where the walnuts grow
 I lost my love, I dare not go
 </i>
She held a baby in her arms...

She had a penknife long and sharp...

She stabbed the baby in the heart...

The county police came riding by...

The magistrate said she must die...

They hanged her from the walnut tree...

And that was the end of Old Mother Lee...
