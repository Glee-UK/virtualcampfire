Put your arms around me like a circle round the sun
You know I love you Mama, like your easy rider done
You don’t believe I love you, look what a fool I’ve been
You don’t believe I’m sinking, look what a hole I’m in
 <i>
 'Cause I’m stealin', stealin', pretty mama don’t you tell on me
 'Cause I’m a-stealin' back to my same old used to be
 </i>
The woman I love, she’s my size and height
She’s a married woman, so you know she treats me right

You don’t believe I love you, look what a fool I’ve been
You don’t believe I’m sinking, look what a hole I’m in

The woman I love, she’s so far away
But the woman I hate, why I see her every day
You don’t believe I love you, look what a fool I’ve been
You don’t believe I’m sinking, look what a hole I’m in

Come a little closer honey to my breast
And tell me that I am the one you really love the best
And you don’t have to worry ‘bout any of the rest
‘Cause everything’s gonna be fine
