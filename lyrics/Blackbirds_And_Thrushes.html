If women could run like hares on the common,
If women could run like hares on the common,
How many young men would take horses ride hunting?
Sing fal-de-ral, fal-de-ral, fal-ral-ral-day

If women could swim like fish in the river,
If women could swim like fish in the river,
How many young men would just dive in right after?
Sing fal-de-ral, fal-de-ral, fal-ral-ral-day

If women could grow like lilies and rushes,
If women could grow like lilies and rushes,
How many young men would take scythes and go cutting?
Sing fal-de-ral, fal-de-ral, fal-ral-ral-day

If women could sing like blackbirds and thrushes,
If women could sing like blackbirds and thrushes,
How many young men would just dive in them bushes?
Sing fal-de-ral, fal-de-ral, fal-ral-ral-day

If women could grow like trees in the forest
If women could grow like trees in the forest
How many young men would just climb up like monkeys
Sing fal-de-ral, fal-de-ral, fal-ral-ral-day

If women could howl like wolves in the forest
If women could howl like wolves in the forest
How many young men would just run to the florist
Sing fal-de-ral, fal-de-ral, fal-ral-ral-day
