  All On The Shore

<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>
As I was a-walking all by the seaside
 <i>All on the shore and over strand</i>
I met with a body washed up by the tide
 <i>All on the shore, a long time ago</i>

I took him to southreps the place he was born...
And straight way to northreps the place he was known...

I emptied his bowels and pulled out his feet...
And garnished him over with parsley so sweet...

I pulled out his toenails and likewise his teeth...
And sent them to napton wrapped up in a leaf...

I poked out his eyes with a rusty old nail...
And emptied his giblets out into a pail...

I cut off his legs and likewise his arms...
And then I chopped off all his masculine charms...

I pulled out his liver, his kidneys as well...
Because he was dead! As best I could tell...
