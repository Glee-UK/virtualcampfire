<pre>
He sits at the corner of Beggars Bush
Astride of an old packing case
And the dolls at the end of the plank were dancing
As he crooned with a smile on his face
 <i>
 Da Da Da Da, come day go day
 Wish in me heart it was Sunday
 La La La drinking buttermilk all the week
 But it’s whisky on a Sunday
 </i>
His tired old hands have a wooden beam
And the puppets they dance up and down
A far better show than you ever will see
In the fanciest theatre in town

In 1902 old Seth Davey died
His song was heard no more
The three dancing dolls in the dustbin were thrown
And the plank went to mend the back door

On some stormy night if you’re passing that way
And the winds blowing up from the sea
You will still hear the sound of old Seth Davey
As he croons to his dancing girls three
