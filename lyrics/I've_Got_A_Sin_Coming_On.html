<pre>
I've got a sin coming on
I've got a right that's about to go wrong
I've got a shiver down to my bones
And I've got a sin coming on
I've got a buzz in my brain
Drunk like in love going down like champagne
I've got a feeling this is gonna leave a lipstick stain
And I'll be the only one to blame

And you can see it
All over my face
Sweet temptation
All over the place
Give me tall, dark and handsome
Mix it up with something strong
I've got a sin coming on

Please help me hold this back
I know it ain't right, but I want it so bad
Smoke and the whiskey's
Got me feeling easy
And after I'll fade into black.

And you can see it
All over my face
Sweet temptations
All over the place
Give me tall, dark and handsome
Mix it up with something strong
I feel a sin coming on
