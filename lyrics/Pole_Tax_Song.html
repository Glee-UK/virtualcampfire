  Pole Tax Song
</h1>
<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>
It’s so very taxing, My tent is collapsing
I found myself one pole too short
So I phoned up the council, they said, Hey you scoundrel
We’re going to take you to court
 <i>
 North Pole, South Pole, flag pole, bean pole
 But there’s one pole you can axe
 It’s the p... p... p... p... p... pole tax
 </i>
There’s been infiltration
In this organisation
The taxmen are dressed as camp chiefs
Hogg’ll ogle your tent

And you know what is meant
He’s really just one more pole thief
I’m cheesed off with camping
My spirits are dampening

My tent without poles is sod all
I want bricks and mortar
And hot running water
So I’ll go and install at Rushall
