 Nine Hundred Miles

<pre>
I’ve been walking down this track, I’ve got tears in my eyes
Trying to read this letter from my home
 <i>
 If this train runs me right I’ll be home tomorrow night
 I’m nine hundred miles from my home
 And I hate to hear that lonesome whistle blow
 </i>
Now this train that I’m on is a hundred coaches long
Hear that whistle blow a hundred miles

I’ve pawned you my watch and I’ve pawned you my chain
Pawned you my diamond golden ring

If my mama tells me so I can’t railroad no more
I’ll sidetrack my engine, go on home
