 Blow the Candle Out

<pre>
There was a young apprentice who went to meet his dear.
The moon was shining brightly and the stars were viewing clear.
He went to his love’s window and he called her by her name,
Then she arose to meet him, and then back to bed again.

“Oh Willie, dearest Willie, tonight will be your doom.
Now strip into your nightshirt and bear one night within.
The streets they are too lonely for you to walk about,
Come roll me in your arms, love, and we'll blow the candle out.

“My father and my mother, next bedroom they do lie,
Kissing and embracing, so why not you and I?
Kissing and embracing without a fear or doubt,
So come roll me in your arms, love, we'll blow the candle out.“

It was six months and after six, six weeks or so today,
He wrote to me a letter saying he was far away;
He wrote his love a letter without a fear or doubt
And he never said when he’d return to blow the candle out.

Come all you gallant highway girls take heed to what I say
Never court a young man that ploughs the angry sea
For one way or another, while you are out about,
And he’ll leave you as he left me when he blew my candle out.
