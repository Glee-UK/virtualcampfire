A long time ago, when the Earth was green
There was more kinds of animals than you’ve ever seen
They’d run around free while the Earth was being born
And the loveliest of all was the unicorn

There was green alligators and long-necked geese
Some humpty backed camels and some chimpanzees
Some cats and rats and elephants, but sure as you’re born
The loveliest of all was the unicorn

The Lord seen some sinning and it gave him pain
And he said, “Stand back, I’m going to make it rain”
He said, “Hey, Brother Noah, I’ll tell you what to do
I want you to build me a floating zoo”

And take two green alligators and a couple of geese
Two humpty backed camels and two chimpanzees
Two cats, two rats, two elephants, but sure as you’re born
Noah, don’t you forget my unicorns

Old Noah was there to answer the call
He finished making the ark just as the rain started to fall
He marched the animals two by two
And he called out as they came through

Hey Lord, I’ve got two green alligators, a couple of geese
Two humpty backed camels and two chimpanzees
Two cats, two rats, two elephants, but Lord, I’m so forlorn
I just can’t find no unicorns

And Noah looked out through the driving rain
Them unicorns were hiding, playing silly games
Kicking and splashing while the rain was falling
Oh, them foolish unicorns

There was green alligators and long-necked geese
Some humpty backed camels and some chimpanzees
Some cats and rats and elephants, but sure as you’re born
The loveliest of all was the unicorn

Then the ducks started duckin’ and the snakes started snakin’
And the elephants started elephantin’ and the boat started shakin’
The mice started squeakin’ and the lions started roarin’
And everyone’s aboard but them unicorns

I mean the green alligators and long-necked geese
The humpty backed camels and the chimpanzees
Noah cried, “Close the door because the rain is falling
And we just can’t wait for no unicorns”

The ark started moving, it drifted with the tide
The unicorns looked up from the rocks and they cried
And the waters came down and sort of floated them away
That’s why you never see unicorns to this very day

You’ll see a lot of alligators and a whole mess of geese
You’ll see humpty backed camels and chimpanzees
You’ll see cats and rats and elephants, but sure as you’re born
You’re never gonna see no unicorn
