  Orchestra Song
</h1>
<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>
 The violins of all the strings
 They take the lead and have the most to do
 They gaily play the melody
 And sing the tune the whole way through

 The clarinet, the clarinet of all the woodwinds
 We most notes can get
 A single reed is all we need
 To make a smooth and mellow sound

 The horns, the horns of curling brass
 Can murmur low
 Or loudly blast

 For a fanfare a trumpety sound is best
 A trumpety sound is best
 A trumpety sound is best
 For a fanfare a trumpety sound is best
 A trumpety sound is best
 A trumpety sound is best
 Is best

 The kettle drums
 Echo the two notes we best know
 So Doh Doh Soh Soh Soh Soh Soh Doh
