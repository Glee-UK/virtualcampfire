 An Old Woman Of Yorkshire
</h1>
<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>
There was an old woman in Yorkshire, in Yorkshire she did dwell;
She loved her husband dearly and another man twice as well.

<i>
 Ti me fal-the-doo-ra-lido, fal-the-doo-ra-lay.
</i>

She went unto the doctor to see if she could find,
Something to give her husband for to make him blind.

She bought a stone of marrow bones and made him eat them all.
The old man said, "I am so blind I can't see nowt at all."

The old man broken-hearted he unto her did say,
"I'm sure that I would drown meself if I could find the way."

"If you will go and drown yourself, and that without delay,
If you will go and drown yourself, now I'll show you the way."

So they both went hand in hand unto the river's brim,
The old man wadn't drown hisself unless she shoved him in.

So she stepped back a yard or two for to shove wiv all her might,
The old man quickly stepped aside and in she tummled quite.

Good lord how she did holler, good lord how she did bawl,
The old man said, "I am so blind I can't see nowt at all."

She swam until she floated unto the river's brim,
The old man took his walking stick and shoved her farther in.

So now me song is ended and what do you all think?
He's a damn poor singer if he didn't 'arn a drink.
