  Process Man
</h1>
<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>
A process man am I and I’m telling you no lie
I’ve worked and breathed among the fumes that trail acros the sky
There’s thunder all around me and poison in the air
There’s a lousy smell that smacks of hell and dust all in my hair
 <i>
 And it’s go, boy, go
 They’ll time your every breath
 And every day you’re in this place
 You’re two days nearer death
 But you go
 </i>
I’ve worked among the spinners, breathed in the oily smoke
I’ve shovelled up the gypsum and it nigh on makes you choke
I’ve been knee-deep in cyanide, got sick with caustic burn
Been working rough, i’ve seen enough to make your stomach turn

There’s overtime, there’s bonuses - opportunities galore
The young ones like the money and they all come back for more
But soon you’re knocking on, looking older than you should
For every bob made on the job you pay in flesh and blood

Come all you young fellows and a warning hear me say
Don’t work for Hooker Chemical on the shores of the Elliot Bay
Don’t take the pay and promises, don’t bet your youth so strong
Don’t end up like me at 33, no one to sing your song
