 Day-o, me say day-o
 Daylight come and me wan’ go home
 Day-o, me say day-o
 Daylight come and me wan’ go home
 </i>
Hey, all of the workmen sing this song
Daylight come and me wan’ go home
Well I sleep by the sun and I work by the moon
Daylight come and me wan’ go home

Work all night ‘til the morning come
Daylight come and me wan’ go home
Stack them banana ‘til the morning come
Daylight come and me wan’ go home

Come, Mr. Tallyman, tally me banana
Daylight come and me wan’ go home
Me say, come Mr. Tallyman, tally me banana
Daylight come and me wan’ go home

Lift six hand, seven hand, eight hand bunch
Daylight come and me wan’ go home
Me say, six hand, seven hand, eight hand bunch
Daylight come and me wan’ go home

A beautiful bunch o’ ripe banana
Daylight come and me wan’ go home
Out come a big, black, hairy tarantula
Daylight come and me wan’ go home

Well, I’ll pack up my things and I’ll go to sea
Daylight come and me wan’ go home
Then the bananas see the last of me
Daylight come and me wan’ go home
