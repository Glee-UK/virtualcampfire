  I Dare Not Let You In

<pre>
It hails, and rains, and goes and blows,
And I am wet right through my clothes.
So I pray love, let me in,
So I pray love, let me in.

To let you in, that cannot be,
There’s no-one in this house but me.
So I dare not let you in,
So I dare not let you in.

Me dad and mam, are fast asleep,
Me brother is up, but he’s with the sheep.
So I dare not let you in,
So I dare not let you in.

He turned him round, and whether to go,
When sweet affection did she show.
Oh come now, I’ll let you in,
Oh come now, I’ll let you in.

They spent that night in sweet content,
And the very next morning to church they went.
Where he made her his charming bride,
Where he made her his charming bride.
