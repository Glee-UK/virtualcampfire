 Song for Seth
</h1>
<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>
Oh oh oh my love I see you,
You dance so close to me
But when I reach to touch you
I find just memory.
 <i>
 Your smile, your dance, your laughter
 I know like my heartbeat.
 You’re mine and will remain so
 A love death can’t defeat.
 </i>
In wind I feel and hear you,
It makes my soul rejoice,
Dancing like your spirit,
I can almost hear your voice.

Some mornings when I wake up.
I listen for your feet,
For you to bounce in smiling
And in my arms to creep.

Oh oh how I long to hold you
For you in my arms to rest,
For you to clamber on me,
Settle where you fit best.

Everywhere I see the spaces,
Where other children play,
I spy your shadow in these places,
They grow but young you stay.

In starry nights I’ll find you,
Shining to keep me strong
And gathering round our campfire,
You’ll be there in every song.
