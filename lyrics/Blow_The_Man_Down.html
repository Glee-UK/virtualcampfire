Oh! Blow the man down, bullies, blow the man down!
Way Ay! Blow the man down!
Oh! Blow the man down, bullies, blow him away
Gimme me some time to blow the man down

As I was a-walking down Paradise Street
Way Ay! Blow the man down!
A saucy young damsel I happened to meet
Gimme me some time to blow the man down

I says to her “Polly, and how do you do?”
Way Ay! Blow the man down!
She says, “None the better for seeing of you”
Gimme me some time to blow the man down

Oh! We’ll blow the man up and we’ll blow the man down
Way Ay! Blow the man down!
We’ll blow him away into Liverpool Town
Gimme me some time to blow the man down
