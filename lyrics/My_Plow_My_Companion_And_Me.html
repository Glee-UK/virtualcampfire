 My Plow My Companion And Me
</h1>
<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>
All the flowers that I loved in the wildwood
Have since lost their beautiful blooms
And the memories dear friends of my childhood
Have slumbered for years in the dunes
<i>
It’s no wonder I’m broken-hearted
And stricken with sorrow shall be
We have lived, we have loved, we have parted
My plow, my companion and me
</i>
Just think of that lovely dark morning
When the spirit of earth shall be free
And we meet who we’ve loved in the dawning
My plow, my companion and me
<i>
It’s no wonder I’m broken-hearted
And stricken with sorrow shall be
We have lived, we have loved, we have parted
My plow, my companion and me
</i>
