If I could, I surely would
Stand on the rock where Moses stood
 <i>
 Pharaoh’s army got drowned
 O Mary don’t you weep
 O Mary don’t you weep, don’t you moan
 O Mary don’t you weep, don’t you moan
 Pharaoh’s army got drowned
 O Mary don’t you weep
 </i>
Mary wore three links of chain
And on each link was Jesus’ name

Mary wore three links of chain
And every one was Freedom’s name

One of these nights, about twelve o-clock
This old world’s going to reel and rock

Moses stood on the Red Sea shore
Shooting the water with a two-by-four

God gave Noah the rainbow sign
No more water but fire next time

The Lord told Moses what to do
To lead those Hebrew children through
