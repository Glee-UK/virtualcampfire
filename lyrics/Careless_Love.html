Love, oh love, oh careless love
Love, oh love, oh careless love
Love, oh love, oh careless love
Can’t you see what careless love can do

Sorrow, sorrow to my heart...
That my true love and I must part

When my apron strings did bow...
You followed me through sleet and snow

Now my apron strings won’t pin...
You pass my door and won’t come in

Cried last night and the night before...
Gonna cry tonight and never no more

Love my momma and my poppa too...
But I’d leave them both to go with you

How I wish that train would come...
And take me back to where I come from

Love, oh love, oh careless love...
Can’t you see what careless love can do
