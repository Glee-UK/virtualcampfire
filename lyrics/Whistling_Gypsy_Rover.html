 Whistling Gypsy Rover
</h1>
<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>
A gypsy rover came over the hill
Down through the valley so shady
He whistled and he sang till the green woods rang
And he won the heart of a lady
<i>
 Ah de doo, ah de doo dah day
 Ah de doo, ah de day-o
 And he whistled and he sang till the green woods rang
 And he won the heart of a lady
</i>
She left her fatherâ€™s castle great
Left her own fond lover
Left her servants and her state
To follow the gypsy rover

Her father saddled his fastest steed
And searched his valleys all over
Seeking his daughter at great speed
And the whistling gypsy rover

At last he came to a mansion fine
Along the river shady
And there was music and there was wine
For the gypsy and his lady

He is no gypsy, my father, she said
But Lord of these free lands all over
And I will stay till my dying day
With my Whistling Gypsy Rover
