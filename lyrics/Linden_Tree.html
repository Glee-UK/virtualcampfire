  Linden Tree

<pre>
I saw my gentle Mother
Fast fading day by day
And like a captive songster
Her spirit soared away.

And oh they say my father
Was buried in the sea
But they buried Sister Mary
Beneath the linden tree.

And oh, alas, how dreary
The earth was cold and chill
With no one left to cheer me
But gentle brother Will.

We loved each other fondly
And roamed the world with glee
But now he sleeps dear Willie
Beneath the linden tree.

I know that I am dying
I'm fading fast away
Like mist clouds on the ocean
Like night before the day.

I soon shall join the circle
And happy, happy, be
And then they'll lay me down to rest
Beneath the linden tree
