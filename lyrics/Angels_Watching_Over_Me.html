All night, all day,
Angels watching over me Lord.
All night, all day,
Angels watching over me.

Now I lay me down to sleep
Angels watching over me Lord.
Pray The Lord my soul to keep
Angels watching over me.

All night, all day,
Angels watching over me Lord.
All night, all day,
Angels watching over me.

If I die before I wake
Angels watching over me Lord.
Pray the lord my soul to take
Angels watching over me.

All night, all day,
Angels watching over me Lord.
All night, all day,
Angels watching over me.

If I live forever and a day
Angels watching over me Lord.
Pray the lord guide me a way
Angels watching over me.

All night, all day,
Angels watching over me Lord.
All night, all day,
Angels watching over me.
