<pre>
And who are you, my pretty fair maid
And who are you, my honey?
And who are you, my pretty fair maid
And who are you, my honey?
She answered me quite modestly,
“Well I am my mother’s darling.”
 <i>
 With your too-ry-ah, Fol-de-diddle-dah
 Me Day-re fol-de-diddle, Da ri oh
 </i>
And will you come to my house in the middle of the night
When the moon is shining clearly.
Will you come to my house in the middle of the night
When the moon is shining clearly.
I’ll open the door and I’ll let you in
And the devil the one will hear us.

So I went to her house in the middle of the night
When the moon was shining clearly
So I went to her house in the middle of the night
When the moon was shining clearly
She opened the door and she let me in
And the devil the one did hear us.

She took my horse by the bridle and the bit
And she led him to the stable
She took my horse by the bridle and the bit
And she led him to the stable
Saying “There’s plenty of oats for a soldier’s horse,
To eat it if he’s able.”

Then she took me by the lily-white hand
And she led me to the table
Then she took me by the lily-white hand
And she led me to the table
Saying “There’s plenty of wine for a soldier boy,
For to drink if he is able.”

Then I got up and I made the bed
And I made it nice and easy
Then I got up and I made the bed
And I made it nice and easy
Then I got up and I laid her down
Saying “Lassie are you able?”

There we lay till the break of the day
And the devil the one did hear us
There we lay till the break of the day
And the devil the one did hear us
Then I arose and put on my clothes
Saying “Lassie, I must leave you.”

And when will you return again?
And when will we get married?
And when will you return again?
And hen will we get married?
When broken shells make Christmas bells
We might well get married.
