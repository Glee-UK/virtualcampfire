 As I Roved Out

Who are you, me pretty fair maid
Who are you, me honey?
Who are you, me pretty fair maid
Who are you, me honey?
She answered me quite modestly:
 “I am me mammy’s darling.”
 <i>
 With your too-ry-ah, Fol-de-diddle-dah
 Me Day-re fol-de-diddle, Da ri oh
 </i>
Will you come to me house in the middle of the night
When the moon is shining clearly
And will you come to me house in the middle of the night
When the moon is shining clearly
I’ll open the door and I’ll let you in
And devil the one will hear us

So I went to her house in the middle of the night
When the moon was shining clearly
So I went to her house in the middle of the night
When the moon was shining clearly
She opened the door and she let me in
And devil the one did hear us

She took me horse by the bridle and the bit
And she led it to the stable
She took me horse by the bridle and the bit
And she led it to the stable
Saying “There’s plenty of oats for a soldier’s horse,
For eat if he is able.”

She took me by the lily-white hand
And she led me to the table
She took me by the lily-white hand
And she led me to the table
Saying “There’s plenty of wine for a soldier boy,
For to drink if he is able.”

She got up and she made the bed
And she made it nice and easy
She got up and she made the bed
And she made it nice and easy
Then she took me by the lily-white hand
Saying “God, I hope you’re able!”

There we lay till the break of the day
And devil the one did hear us
There we lay till the break of the day
And devil the one did hear us
She arose and put on her clothes
Saying “Darling, you must leave me.”

When will I return again
When will we be married
When will I return again
When will we be married
When broken shells make Christmas bells
We might well get married
