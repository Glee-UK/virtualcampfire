  Snow Sniffing Lament
</h1>
<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>
Morphine Bill and Cocaine Sue
Were walking down 5th Avenue
 <i>
 Singing honey have a (sniff) have a (sniff) on me
 Honey have a (sniff) on me
 </i>
They came to a drugstore painted green
The sign outside said “No Morphine”

They came to a drugstore finished in oak
The sign outside said “No More Coke”

They came to a drugstore painted red
The sign outside said “We’re All Dead”

They came to a drugstore painted blue
The sign outside said “We’re Dead Too”

So in the river, side by side
They both committed suicide

And in the graveyard on the hill
Lies the body of Morphine Bill

And in the graveyard on the side
Lies the body of his Cocaine Bride

The moral of this story goes
There ain’t no good in sniffing snow
