<pre>
Don’t mind the rain or the rolling sea
The weary night never worries me
But the hardest time in a sailor’s day
Is to watch the sun as it dies away
Here’s one more day on the Grey Funnel Line

The finest ship that sails the sea
Is still a prison for the likes of me
But give me wings like Noah’s dove
I’d fly up harbour to the girl I love
Here’s one more day on the Grey Funnel Line

Oh Lord, if only dreams were real
I’d have my hands on that wooden wheel
And with all my heart I’d turn her round
And tell the boys that we’re homeward bound
Here’s one more day on the Grey Funnel Line

I’ll pass the time like some machine
Until blue water turns to green
Then I’ll dance on down that walk ashore
And sail the Grey Funnel Line no more
And sail the Grey Funnel Line no more
