Mathilda that's the name
Every female playing her game
I wish her to see what she has done to me
And so I have set it in song

You always said that I was wrong
My silence that you had raised
But you will not listen
And lack of vision
My life you did not pick
<i>
Mathilda, Mathilda can't you see
Mathilda I need your company
Mathilda, Mathilda talk to me
Mathilda, Mathilda wait for me
</i>
Like better flowers than snow
Our love has an ending I know
Our love made a glutton
That won't be forgotten
And to the waste I must go
<i>
Mathilda, Mathilda can't you see
Mathilda I need your company
Mathilda, Mathilda talk to me
Mathilda, Mathilda wait for me
</i>
I want you, I need you
You tell me that you don't need me too
But you look in my eyes
And sigh me some goodbyes
<i>
Mathilda, Mathilda can't you see
Mathilda I need your company
Mathilda, Mathilda talk to me
Mathilda, Mathilda wait for me
</i>
My life line is broken in two
All of it belongs to you
North south east west
Is me in your breast
But to me you will not stay true
<i>
Mathilda, Mathilda can't you see
Mathilda I need your company
Mathilda, Mathilda talk to me
Mathilda, Mathilda wait for me
</i>
The waiting is over the stand
Stroking the shawl of her hair
Soothing the shingles
Reclassified as lonely and sad down her spine
<i>
Mathilda, Mathilda can't you see
Mathilda I need your company
Mathilda, Mathilda talk to me
Mathilda, Mathilda why won't you wait for me
