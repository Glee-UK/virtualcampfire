Peace In The Valley

<pre>
Well the wolves will be gentle
And the bear will be tame
And the lion shall lay down by the lamb, oh yes
And the beasts from the wild
Shall be led by a child
And I'll be changed, changed from this creature that I am, oh yes

There will be peace in the valley for me, some day
There will be peace in the valley for me, oh Lord I pray
There'll be no sadness, no sorrow, oh my Lord
No trouble, trouble I see
There will be peace in the valley for me
