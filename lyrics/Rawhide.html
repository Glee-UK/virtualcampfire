Rollin', rollin', rollin'
Keep them doggies rollin'
Keep them wagons rollin'
Rawhide

Through rain and wind and weather
Hell-bent for leather
Wishing my girl was by my side
All the things I'm missin', good vittles, love and kissin'
Are waitin' at the end of my ride

Move 'em on, head 'em up, head 'em up, move 'em on
Move 'em on, head 'em up, rawhide
Cut 'em out, ride 'em in, ride 'em in, cut 'em out
Cut 'em out, ride 'em in
Rawhide

Movin', movin', movin'
Movin', movin', movin'
Though they're disapproving
Keep them doggies movin'
Rawhide

Don't try to understand 'em
Just rope and pull and brand 'em
Soon we'll be livin' high and wide
My heart's calculating, my true love will be waiting
Be waiting at the end of my ride

Move 'em on, head 'em up, head 'em up, move 'em on
Move 'em on, head 'em up, rawhide
Cut 'em out, ride 'em in, ride 'em in, cut 'em out
Cut 'em out, ride 'em in
Rawhide

Rollin', rollin', rollin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin'
Rollin', rollin', rollin'
Rawhide
