     Fare thee well, Old Joe Clark
     Fare thee well I'm gone
     Fare thee well, Old Joe Clark
     And goodbye Betsy Brown 

Once I lived on the mountain top
Now I live in town; 
I'm staying at the big hotel
Courtin' Betsy Brown.

     Fare thee well, Old Joe Clark
     Fare thee well I'm gone
     Fare thee well, Old Joe Clark
     And goodbye Betsy Brown 

Old Joe Clark he had a mule,
His name was Morgan Brown,
And every tooth in that mule's head
Was sixteen inches around.

     Fare thee well, Old Joe Clark
     Fare thee well I'm gone
     Fare thee well, Old Joe Clark
     And goodbye Betsy Brown 

Old Joe Clark had a yellow cat,
She would neither sing or pray,
She stuck her head in the buttermilk jar
And washed her sins away.

     Fare thee well, Old Joe Clark
     Fare thee well I'm gone
     Fare thee well, Old Joe Clark
     And goodbye Betsy Brown 

Old Joe Clark had a house
Fifteen stories high,
And every story in that house
Was filled with chicken pie.

     Fare thee well, Old Joe Clark
     Fare thee well I'm gone
     Fare thee well, Old Joe Clark
     And goodbye Betsy Brown 

I wish I had a sweetheart
I'd put her on a shelf,
And everytime she'd smile at me,
I'd get up there myself.

     Fare thee well, Old Joe Clark
     Fare thee well I'm gone
     Fare thee well, Old Joe Clark
     And goodbye Betsy Brown
