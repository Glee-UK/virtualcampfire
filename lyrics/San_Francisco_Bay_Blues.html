 San Francisco Bay Blues
</h1>
<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>
Got the blues when my baby left me by the San Francisco Bay
Ocean liner, she’s gone so far away
Didn’t mean to treat her so bad
She was the best girl that I ever had
Said goodbye, made me cry
Want to lay down and die
Ain’t got a nickel, I ain’t got a lousy dime
If she don’t come back I think I’m going to lose my mind
If she ever come back to stay, it’ll be another brand new day
Walking with my baby down by the San Francisco Bay

Sitting down on my back step wond’ring which way to go
Girl that I’m crazy ‘bout
She don’t want me no more
Think I’ll take a freight train ‘cause I’m feeling blue
Ride all the way to the end of the line thinking only of you
Meanwhile in another city, just about to fo inasne
thought I heard my baby, the way she used to call my name
If she ever come back to stay, it’ll be another brand new day
Walking with my baby down by the San Francisco Bay
