 Halleluia I’m a Bum

<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>
Oh the winter is gone and the springtime has come
So I’ll pick up my bundle and go on the bum
 <i>
 Halleluia, I’m a bum, Halleluia, bum again
 Halleluia, give us a handout to revive us again
 </i>
Oh I went to a house and I asked for some bread
And the lady said Bum, Bum, the baker is dead

Oh why don’t you work as other men do?
How the hell can I work when there’s no work to do?

Oh why don’t you pray for your daily bread?
Well, if that’s all I did I would damn soon be dead

Oh I went to a house and I knocked on the door
The lady said Bum, Bum, you’ve been here before
