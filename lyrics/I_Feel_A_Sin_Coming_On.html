 I Feel A Sin Comin' On
</h1>
<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>
I feel a sin comin' on
I feel a right that's about to go wrong
I got a shiver down to the bone
I feel a sin comin' on
I got a buzz in my brain
Drunk on a love goin' down like champagne
I got a feelin' it's gonna leave a lipstick stain
And I'll be the only one to blame

And you can see it
All over my face
Sweet temptation
All over the place
Give me tall, dark and handsome
Mix it up with something strong
I feel a sin (I feel a sin) comin' on

Please, Jesus, don't hold me back
I know it ain't mine, but I want it so bad
The smoke and the whiskey's
Got me feeling easy
And the lights are all fadin' to black.
