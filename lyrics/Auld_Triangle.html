<pre>
A hungry feeling, came o’er me stealing
And the mice they were squealing in my prison cell
 <i>
 And the auld triangle, went jingle jangle
 All along the banks of the Royal Canal
 </i>

Oh to start the morning, the warder bawling
Get up out of bed you, and clean at your cell...

Oh the screw was peeping, and the lag was sleeping
As he lay weeping for his girl Sal...

On a fine spring evening, the lag lay dreaming
And the seagulls were wheeling high above the wall...

Oh the wind was sighing, and the day was dying
As the lag lay crying in his prision cell...

In the women’s prison, there are seventy women
And I wish it was with them that I could dwell...
