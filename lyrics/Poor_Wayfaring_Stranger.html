I'm just a poor wayfaring stranger
Traveling through this world below
There is no sickness, no toil, no danger
In that bright land to which I go
I'm going there to meet my father
And going back no more to roam

I'm just going over Jordan
I'm just going over home

I know dark clouds will gather o'er me
I know my path is rough and steep
Bright golden fields lie down before me
Where weary eyes no more can weep
I'm going there to meet my mother
She said she'd meet me when I come

I'm just going over Jordan
I'm just going over home


I want to sing salvation's glory
In concert with the blood-washed band
I want to wear the crown of glory
When I get home to that good land
I am going there to meet my hap crew
Who went before me one by one

I'm just going over Jordan
I'm just going over home
