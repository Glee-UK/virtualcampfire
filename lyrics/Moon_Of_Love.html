Let's go for a little walk
Under the moon of love
Let's sit right down and talk
Under the moon of love

I want to tell you
That I love you
And I want you to be my girl
Little darling let's walk let's talk
Under the moon of love

I want to talk sweet talk
And whisper things in your ear
I want to tell you pretty baby
Things you've been longing to hear

Come on little darling take my hand
Let's go for a little walk
Under the moon of love
Let's sit right down and talk
Under the moon of love

I want to tell you
That I love you
And I want you to be my girl
Little darling let's walk let's talk
Under the moon of love
