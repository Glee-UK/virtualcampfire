  Poor Boy
</h1>
<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>
As I went down to the river, poor boy
To see the ships go by
My sweetheart stood on the deck of one
And she waved to me good-bye
<i>
Bow down your head and cry, poor boy
Bow down your head and cry
Stop thinking about that woman you love
Bow down your head and cry
</i>
I followed her for months and months
She offered me her hand
We were just about to get married, when
She ran off with a gambling man

He came at me with a big jack knife
I went for him with lead
When the fight was over, poor boy
He lay down beside me, dead

They took me to the big jail house
The months, the months rolled by
The jury found me guilty, poor boy
And the Judge said you must die

And yet they call this justice, poor boy
Then justice let it be
I only killed a man that was
Just a-fixing to kill me
