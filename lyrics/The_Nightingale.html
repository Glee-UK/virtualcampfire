As I was walking one morning in May
I heard a young couple so fondly did stray
And one was a fair maid as fair as can be
And the other was a soldier of the brave Grenadiers
 <i>
 And they kissed so sweet and comforting as they clung to each other
 They went arm in arm along the road like sister and brother
 They went arm in arm along the road till they came to a stream
 And they both sat down together love to hear the nightingale sing
 </i>
Then out from his knapsack he drew a fine fiddle
And he played her such a merry tune as you ever did hear
And he played her such a merry tune as the valley did ring
“Oh hush”, cried the fair maid, “let the nightingales sing”

I’m off to India for seven long years
Drinking wines and strong whiskies instead of strong beers
And if ever I return again it’ll be in the spring
And we’ll both sit down together love to hear the nightingale sing

Oh, then says the fair maid, “Won’t you marry me?”
“Oh no”, says the soldier, “However could that be?”
For I’ve my son and wife at home in my own country
And she is the fairest little maid as you ever did see
