Silver Dagger

<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>
Don't sing love songs, you'll wake my mother
She's sleeping here, right by my side
And in her right hand, a silver dagger
She says that I can't be your bride

"All men are fools " says my mother
They'll tell you wicked, loving lies
The next breath, they'll court another
And leave you where the sun don't rise

My daddy is a handsome devil
He's got a chain five miles long
And on every link a heart does dangle
Of another maid he's loved and wronged

So then go home to your own garden
Then go home return no more
No other man may come a courting
No other man may cross my door

Don't sing love songs, you'll wake my mother
She's sleeping here, right by my side
And in her right hand, a silver dagger
She says that I can't be your bride
