In eighteen hundred and eighty one
The American Railway was begun
The American Railway was begun
The Great American Railway
 Patsy - atsy - or - ee - ay
 Patsy - atsy - or - ee - ay
 Patsy - atsy - or - ee - ay
 The Great American Railway
or:
 I was wearing corduroy breeches, digging ditches
 Swinging switches, dodging hitches
 I was working on the Railway

In eighteen hundred and eighty two
I found myself with nothing to do...
Just beside the Railway

In eighteen hundred and eighty three
The overseer accepted me...
To work upon the Railway

In eighteen hundred and eighty four
My hands were tired and my feet were sore...
From working on the Railway

In eighteen hundred and eighty five
I found myself more dead than alive...
From working on the Railway

In eighteen hundred and eighty six
I trod on a bundle of dynamite sticks...
Just beside the Railway

In eighteen hundred and eighty seven
I found myself half way to heaven...
Just above the Railway

In eighteen hundred and eighty eight
I picked the lock of the Golden Gate...
With a crowbar from the Railway

In eighteen hundred and eighty nine
I found my wings and a harp divine...
Overlooking the Railway

In eighteen hundred and eighty ten
If you want any more you can sing it again...
All about the Railway
