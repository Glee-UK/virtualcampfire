 I Wonder If I'm Growing

Oh I wonder if I'm growing
Yes I wonder if I'm growing
My mum says "yes you're growing"
But it's hard for me to see

My mum says eat your sandwich
And then you'll grow up tall
But when I eat my sandwich
I'm hardly bigger at all

And I wonder if I'm growing
Yes I wonder if I'm growing
My mum says yes you're growing
But it's hard for me to see

My mum says wash your hands now
Then you can go and play
Hey! I can reach the tap now
For the very first time today

And I know that I am growing
Yes I know that I am growing
My mum says yes I'm growing
And now I know it's true
