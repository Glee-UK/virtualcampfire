Well one morning last autumn I was walking my dogs
When the Duke of Wellington we did meet.
Well Bonzo and Rover, they slobbered him all over,
While Dido nearly knocked him off his feet.
<i>
Well there was….
Dido, Fido, Bonzo and Rex
Rover and Lassie and Spot
There was Butch, there was Candy
There was Patch and there was Sandy
These were the dogs what I had got.
</i>
Well don’t worry sir I said,
He won’t hurt you that’s just
His way of saying he like you a lot.
Well he took my little dog, and he kicked him in the bog
And said that’s my way of showing I do not.

They chased a rabbit over the plain,
but that chased them back again
Which put my poor old dogs in quite a stew.
Now it’s just 12 months today
Since I heard the squire say
”I should have them all put down, if I was you.”

Now the next dog being old, he was a trifle deaf
He couldn’t hear a single word I said.
And so when I told him sit, he made an awful mess.
When I cleaned it up I shot the bugger dead.

Now the next dog being daft, and not all the ticket
He made straight away for the river.
And there he did jump in, but the bugger couldn’t swim
That’s the last we saw of him forever.
