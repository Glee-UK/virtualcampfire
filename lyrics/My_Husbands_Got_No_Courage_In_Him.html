  My Husbands Got No Courage In Him

<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>
As I went out one May morning
To view the fields and leaves a-springing
I saw two maidens standing by
And one of them her hands was wringing
And all of their conversation went
My husband’s got no courage in him
 <i>
 Oh dear-o, Oh dear-o
 Me husband’s got no courage in him!
 Oh dear-o
 </i>
Me husband’s admired wherever he goes
And everyone looks well upon him
With his handsome features and well-shaped leg
But still he’s got no courage in him

Me husband can dance and caper and sing
And do anything that’s fitting for him
But he cannot do the thing I want
Because he’s got no courage in him

All sorts of victuals I did provide
All sorts of meats that’s fitting for him
With oyster pie and rhubarb too
But still he’s got no courage in him

Every night when I goes to bed
I lie and throw me leg right o’er him
And my hand I clamp between his thighs
But I can’t put any courage in him

Seven long years I’ve made his bed
And every night I’ve lain beside him
But this morning I rose with me maidenhead
For still he’s got no courage in him

I wish me husband he was dead
And in his grave I’d quickly lay him
And then I’d find another one
That’s got a little courage in him
