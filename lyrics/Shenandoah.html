 <i>
 Oh Shenandoah, I long to hear you
 Away you rolling river
 Oh Shenandoah, I long to hear you
 Away we’re bound to go, ‘Cross the wide Missouri
 </i>

The white man loved the Indian maiden
 <i>Away you rolling river</i>
With notions his canoe was laden
 <i>Away we’re bound to go, ‘Cross the wide Missouri</i>

Oh Shenandoah, I love your daughter...
I’ll take her ‘cross the rolling water...

Oh Shenandoah, I took a notion...
To sail across the stormy ocean...

‘Tis seven long years since last I saw her...
‘Tis seven long years the love I’ve borne her...

He sold the chief the fire water...
And ‘cross the river stole his daughter...

Oh Shenandoah, I’m bound to leave you...
Oh Shenandoah, I’ll not deceive you...

She went away and took another...
She went away, forsook her lover...
