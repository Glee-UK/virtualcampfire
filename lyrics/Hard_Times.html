 Hard Times
</h1>
<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>
Let us pause in life’s pleasures and count its many tears
While we all sup sorrow with the poor
There’s a song that will linger forever in our ears
Oh hard times come again no more
<i>
 ‘Tis the song, the sigh of the weary
 Hard times, hard times come again no more
 Many days you have lingered around my cabin door
 Oh hard times come again no more
</i>
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay
There are frail forms fainting at the door
Though their voices are silent their pleading looks still say
Oh hard times come again no more...

There’s a pale drooping maiden who toils her life away
With a worn heart whose better days are o’er
Though her voice would be merry she’s sighing all the day
Oh hard times come again no more...

‘Tis a sigh that is wafted across the troubled wave
‘Tis a wail that is heard upon the shore
‘Tis a dirge that is murmured around the lowly grave
Oh hard times come again no more...
