Oh please tell me, what is this sailboat's name?
It's the sailboat Malarkey
Tell me, tell me, what is it's name?
It's the sailboat Malarkey

Who is the man then who built this fine boat?
It's the sailboat Malarkey
Richardson, Richardson built this fine boat
It's the sailboat Malarkey

She's lovely aloft and she's lovely below
It's the sailboat Malarkey
But she's best on her back as you very well know
It's the sailboat Malarkey
