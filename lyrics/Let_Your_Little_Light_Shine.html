Let you little light shine shine shine
Let your little light shine down on me
Don't you there's someone down in the valley trying to get home
Trying to get home

Let you little light shine shine shine
Let your little light shine down on me
Don't you there's someone down in the valley trying to get home
Trying to get home

Well it could be me or it could be you
It could be your brother or sister too
Don't you there's someone down in the valley trying to get home
Trying to get home
