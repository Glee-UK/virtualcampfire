<pre>
 While walking down the street one day
 There was a goldfish Store
 And looking in the window was a girl you would adore
 Her eyes were on the goldfish
 Which was looking at the girl
 When suddenly the little girl shouted out with joy
 Oi!
 Little Goldie Goldfish
 Come out and play with me
 Little Goldie Goldfish
 I'm lonesome as can be
 Gee I wish I were a fish and I could swim like you
 We'd catch a whale by its tail
 And sail the ocean blue
 Life would be delicious
 We'd pilot with our fins
 All the other fishes would think that we were twins
 We'd build a pile of seaweed at the bottom of the sea

 Little Goldie goldfish
 Little Goldie goldfish
 Little Goldie goldfish
 Come out and play with me
