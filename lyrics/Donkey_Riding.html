<pre>
 Were you ever in Quebec
 Stowing timber on the deck?
 Where there's a king with a golden crown
 Riding on a donkey
<i>
 Hey ho, away we go, donkey riding, donkey riding
 Hey ho, away we go, riding on a donkey
</i>
 Were you ever off he Horn
 Where it's always fine and warm?
 See the lion and the unicorn
 Riding on a donkey

 Were you ever in Cardiff Bay
 Where the folks all shout Hoorrah!
 Here comes Johnny with his three months pay
 Riding on a donkey
