Oh, me name it is Sam Hall, chimney sweep, chimney sweep
Oh, me name it is Sam Hall, chimney sweep
Oh, me name it is Sam Hall, and I’ve robbed both great and small
And me neck will pay for all, when I die, when I die
And me neck will pay for all, when I die

I have twenty pounds in store, not one more, not one more
I have twenty pounds in store, not one more
I have twenty pounds in store and I’ll rob for twenty more
For the rich must help the poor, so must I, so must I
For the rich must help the poor, so must I

Oh they took me to Cootehill, in a cart, in a cart
Oh they took me to Cootehill, in a cart
Oh they took me to Cootehill where I stopped to make my will
Saying the best of friends must part, so must I, so must I
Saying the best of friends must part, so must I

Up the ladder I did grope, that’s no joke, that’s no joke
Up the ladder I did grope, that’s no joke
Up the ladder I did grope and the hangman pulled the rope
And ne’er a word I spoke, tumbling down, tumbling down
And ne’er a word I spoke tumbling down

Oh my name it is Sam Hall, chimney sweep, chimney sweep
Oh my name it is Sam Hall, chimney sweep
Oh my name it is Sam Hall and I’ve robbed both great and small
And my neck, it paid for all when I died, when I died
And my neck, it paid for all when I died
