My latest sun is sinking fast
My race is nearly run
My strongest trials now are past
My triumph is begun

 <i>
 O come, angel band
 Come and around me stand
 O bear me away on your snowy wings
 To my immortal home
 O bear me away on your snowy wings
 To my immortal home
 </i>

O bear my longing heart to him
Who bled and died for me
Whose blood now cleanses from all sin
And gives me victory

Iâ€™ve almost gained my heavenly home
My spirit loudly sings
The Holy one before me comes
I hear the noise of wings
