 Streets Of London
</h1>
<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>
Have you seen the old man
In the closed down market
Kicking up the papers with his worn out shoes?
In his eyes you see no pride
Arms held loosely by his side
Yesterday’s papers telling yesterday’s news
 <i>
 So how can you tell me you’re lonely
 And say for you the sun don’t shine?
 Let me take you by the hand
 And lead you through the streets of London
 I’ll show you something to make you change your mind
 </i>

Have you seen the old girl
Who walks the streets of London
Dirt in her hair and her clothes in rags
She’s no time for talking
She just keeps right on walking
Carrying her home in two carrier bags

In the all-night café
At a quarter past eleven
Same old man sitting there on his own
Looking at the world over the rim of his tea cup
Each tea lasts an hour
Then he wanders home alone

Have you seen the old man
Outside the Seaman’s Mission
Memory fading with the medal ribbons that he wears
In our winter city, the rain shows little pity
For one more forgotten hero
In a world that doesn’t care
