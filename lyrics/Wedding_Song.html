  Wedding Song
</h1>
<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>
 Come write me down ye powers above
 The man that first created love
 For I've a diamond in my eye
 Where all my joys and comforts lie
 Where all my joys ond comforts lie


 I'll give you gold I'll give you pearl
 If you can fancy me dear girl
 Rich costly robes that you shall wear
 If you can fancy me my dear
 If you con fancy me my dear

 It's not your gold shall me entice
 To leave off pleasures to be a wife
 For I don't mean or intend at all
 To be at any young man's call
 To be at any young man 's call

 Then go your way you scornful dame
 Since you've proved false I'll prove the same
 For I don't care but I shall find
 Some other fair maid to my mind
 Some other fair maid to my mind

 Oh stay young man don't be in haste
 You seem afraid your time will waste
 Let reason rule your roving mind
 And unto you I will prove kind
 And unto you I will prove kind

 So to church they went that very next day
 And were married by asking as I've heard say
 So now that girl she is his wife
 She will prove his comfort day and night
 She will prove his comfort day ond night
