  Move Along
</h1>
<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>
 Born in the middle of the afternoon
 In a horse drawn carriage on the old A5
 The big twelve wheeler shook my bed
 "You can't stay here", the police man said
 "You'd better be born in some place else"
 <i>
 Move along, get along, move along, get along, go! move! shift!
 </i>

 Born on the common by a building site
 Where the ground was rutted by the trailers wheels
 The local Christians said to me
 "You'll lower the price of property
 You'd better get born in some place else"

 Born at potato picking time
 In an old bell tent in a tattie field
 The farmer said "The work's all done
 It's time that you were moving on
 You'd better get born in some place else"

 Born at the back of a hawthorn hedge
 Where the black hoar frost lay on the ground
 No eastern kings came bearing gifts
 Instead the order came to shift
 "You'd better be born in some place else"

 The Eastern sky was full of stars
 And one shone brighter than the rest
 The wise men came so stern and strict
 And brought the orders to evict
 "You'd better be born in some place else'

 Wagon tent or trailer born
 Last month, last year or in far off days
 Born here or a thousand miles away
 There's always men nearby who'll say
 "You'd better be born in some place else"
