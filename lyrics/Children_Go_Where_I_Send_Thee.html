<i>Children go where I send thee, how shall I send thee?</i>
Well I’m going to send thee one by one
One for the iddy, biddy, baby that’s born, born, born,
     born, born in Bethlehem
<i>Children go where I send thee, how shall I send thee?</i>
Well I’m going to send thee two by two
Two for the Paul and Silas
One for the iddy, biddy, baby that’s born, born, born,
     born, born in Bethlehem
<i>Children go where I send thee, how shall I send thee?</i>
Well I’m going to send thee three by three
Three for the Hebrew children
Two for the Paul and Silas
One for the iddy, biddy, baby that’s born, born, born,
     born, born in Bethlehem

Four for the four that stood at the door

Five for the five that got out alive

Six for the six that never had a fix

Seven for the seven that never got to Heaven

Eight for the eight that stood at the gate

Nine for the nine that dressed so fine

Ten for the ten commandments
