 Maids When You're Young
</h1>
<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">

An old man came courting me, hey ding dorum da
An old man came courting me, me being young
An old man came courting me, fain would he marry me
Maids when you’re young never wed an old man
 <i>
 ‘Cause he’s lost his fallorum fal diddle di-orum
 He’s lost his fallorum fal diddle di-ay
 He’s lost his fallorum he’s got no ding dorum
 Oh maids when you’re young never wed an old man
 </i>
When we went to church, hey ding dorum day
When we went to church, me being young
When we went to church, he left me in the lurch
Maids when you’re young never wed an old man

When we went to bed, hey ding dorum day
When we went to bed, me being young
When we went to bed, he lay like he was dead
Maids when you’re young never wed an old man

I threw me leg over him, hey ding dorum day
I threw me leg over him, me being young
I threw me leg over him, damn near did smother him
Maids when you’re young never wed an old man

When he went to sleep, hey ding dorum day
When he went to sleep, me being young
When he went to sleep, out of bed I did leap
Into the arms of a handsome young man
 <i>
 And he’s got me fallorum fal diddle di-orum
 He’s got me fallorum fal diddle di-ay
 He’s got me fallorum I found his ding dorum
 Oh maids when you’re young never wed an old
