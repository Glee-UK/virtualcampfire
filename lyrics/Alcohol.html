<pre>
Started drinking, all around town
Went to a club to put a few more down
Feeling bad, drunk and sad
This is going to be the last drink that I'll ever have

 Alcohol, Alcohol. Alcohol, Alcohol
 You're the very devil. Get away from me

I got in with a crowd, we got in a car
I went to a party, I played a guitar
I never played well, it must have been hell
Made a fool of myself, of that I can tell

I fell in the door, I fell on the street
I fell on the floor, I fell in a heap
I blundered on home, battered and blown
Swore to the Lord, to leave it alone

Next thing I knew, I was back home in bed
My papa was there, he was holding my head
My mama was there, in her nightclothes
Holding a bucket right under my nose

Early next day, I was all in a fuzz
Feeling ashamed, I started to curse
All the money I'd earned, I'd been out and burned
It's a lesson I feel I never seem to learn
