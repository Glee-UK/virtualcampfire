I’m a char-lady’s son, and I’m just thirty one
And me wife’s ten years younger than me
And I don’t like to roam, ‘cos I likes to stay home
But me wife she goes out on a spree
And she leaves me behind, the babies to mind
And the house in a good order to keep
But with the fire burning bright, I could sit half the night
Rocking me babies to sleep
 <i>
 And it’s lady, lady, hush-a-bye baby
 Mammy’ll be coming back by and by
 But with the fire burning bright I could sit half the night
 Rocking me babies to sleep
 </i>
Well last Saturday night I went out for a stroll
After rocking me babies to sleep
When at the bottom of our street, well who do you think I met
But me wife, with a soldier six feet

Well she sobbed and she sighed and she damned nearly died
She say, “Lad I’ve been thinking of thee”
But with the fire burning bright, I could sit half the night
Rocking me babies to sleep
