<pre>
Well you wake up in the morning to the ding dong ring
Go marching to the table, see the same damn thing
Knife and fork upon the table, nothing in my pan
Say anything about it you’re in trouble with the man
 <i>
 Let the Midnight special
 Shine its light on me
 Let the midnight special
 Shine its ever-loving light on me
 </i>
Well yonder come Miss Rosy, how in the world d’you know?
Well I knowed her by her apron and the dress she wore
Umbrella on her shoulder, piece of paper in her hand
She’s gonna tell the Guv’nor turn a-loose my man

Now jumping little Judy was a jumping Queen
And she’s been jumping since she was sixteen
Well she bring me little coffee, she bring me little tea
She bring me damn near everything but the jailhouse key

If you ever go to Houston then you’d better walk right
And you’d better not stagger and you’d better not fight
For the Sheriff will arrest you and carry you down
You can bet your bottom dollar, you’re penitentiary bound
