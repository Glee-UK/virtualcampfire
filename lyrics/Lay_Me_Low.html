They're gonna lay me low (lay me low)
They're gonna sink me in the snow
They're gonna throw back their heads and crow
When I go
They're gonna jump and shout (lay me low)
They're gonna wave their arms about
All the stories will come out
When I go
All the stars will all glow bright (lay me low)
And my friends will give up the fight
They'll see my work in a different light
Yeah, when I go
And they'll try telephoning my mother (lay me low)
But they'll end up getting my brother
Who'll spill the story on some long-gone lover
That I hardly know
Hats off to the man
On top of the world
Come crawl up here, baby
And I'll show you how it works
If you wanna be my friend
And you wanna repent
And you want it all to end
And you wanna know when
Well do it now don't care how
Take your final bow
Make a stand take my hand
And blow it all to hell
They're gonna inform the police chief (lay me low)
Who'll breathe a sigh of relief
He'll say I was a malanderer, a badlander, and a thief
Yeah, when I go
They will interview my teachers (lay me low)
Who'll say I was one of god's sorrier creatures
They'll print informative six-page features
When I go
They'll bang a big old gong (lay me low)
The motorcade will be ten miles long
The world will join together for a farewell song
When they put me down below
They'll sound a fluegelhorn (lay me low)
And the sea will rage, and the sky will storm
All man and beast will mourn
When I go
Hats off to the man
On top of the world
Come crawl up here, baby
And we can watch this damn thing turn
If you wanna be my friend
And you wanna repent
And you want it all to end
And you wanna know when
Well do it now, do it now
Take a long last bow
Take my hand make a stand
And blow it all to hell
Lay me low
Lay me low
Lay me low
Lay me low
Lay me low
Lay me low
Lay me low
Lay me low
Lay me low
Yeah when I go
Yeah, when I
Lay me low
Lay me low
Lay me low
Lay me low
Lay me low
Lay me low
Yeah when I go
Lay me low
Yeah lay me low
Lay me low
Lay me low
