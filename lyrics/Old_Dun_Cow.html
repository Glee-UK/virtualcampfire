<pre>
Some pals and I in a public house
Were playing dominoes last night
When all of a sudden in the potman rushed
With a face just like a kite
“What’s up?” says Brown, “Have you seen your Aunt?
Have you seen your Aunt Maria?”
“Aunt Maria be blowed”, says he
“The bloomin’ pub’s on fire”
“What’s that?” says Brown, “What a bit of luck”
“What a bit of luck”, shouts he
“Down in the cellar with a fire on top
We’ll have a good ol’ spree”
So we all went down with good ol’ Brown
And beer we couldn’t miss
And we hadn’t been ten minutes there
Before we were like this
 <i>
 Oh, there was Brown, upside down
 Knocking back the whiskey on the floor
 “Booze! Booze!” the firemen cried
 As they came a-knocking at the door
 “Don’t let ‘em in till it’s all mopped up”
 Someone shouted, “MacIntyre!”
 And we all got blue-blind paralytic drunk
 When the Old Dun Cow caught fire
 </i>
Old Johnson rushed to the port wine tub
And gave it just a few hard knocks
He started taking off his pantaloons
Likewise his shoes and socks
“Hold on!” says Snoops, “If you wanna wash yer feet
There’s a tub of four ale here
Don’t dip your trotters in the port wine tub
When we’ve still got some old stale beer”

Just then there came such an awful crash
Half the bloomin’ roof gave way
We was run with the firemen’s hose
But still we were all gay
We got some sacks and some old tin tacks
And bunged ourselves inside
And we got drinking good old scotch
‘Til we was bleary eyed
 <i>
 Oh, there was Brown, upside down
 Knocking back the whiskey on the floor
 “Booze! Booze!” the firemen cried
 As they came a-knocking at the door
 “Don’t let ‘em in till it’s all mopped up”
 Someone shouted, “MacIntyre!”
 And we all got blue-blind paralytic drunk
 When the Old Dun Cow caught fire
