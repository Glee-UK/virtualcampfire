<pre>
As I was a-walking one morning last autumn
I overheard some noble fox-hunting
Between some noble men and the Duke of Wellington
So early before the day was dawning
 <i>
 There was Dido, Bendigo, Gentry, he was there-o
 Traveller, he never looked behind him
 There was Countess, Rover, Bonny Lass and Jover
 These are the hounds that would find him
 </i>
Well, the first fox being young and his trials just beginning
He made straight away for the cover
He’s run up yon highest hill,and run down yon lowest ghyll
Thinking that he’d find his freedom there for ever

Now, the next fox being old, and his trials past a-dawning
He’s made straight away for the river
The fox he has jumped in, and an ‘ound jumped after him
It was Traveller, a-striding on for ever

Well, they’ve run across the plain, but they’ll soon return again
The fox nor the hounds never failing
It’s been just one month today since I heard the Squire say
Oh, forward then me brave hounds for ever
