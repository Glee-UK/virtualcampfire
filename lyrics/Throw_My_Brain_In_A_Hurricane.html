<h1>
Throw My Brain In A Hurricane
</h1>

<pre>
Woke up this morning
Put on my slippers
Walked in the kitchen and died
And oh what a feeling
When my soul went thru the ceiling
And on up into heaven I did ride
When I got there they did say
John, it happened this a'way
You slipped upon the floor
And hit your head
And all the angels say
Just before you passed away
These were the very last words
That you said

Please don't bury me
Down in the cold cold ground
No, I'd rather have 'em cut me up
And pass me all around
Throw my brain in a hurricane
And the blind can have my eyes
And the deaf can take both of my ears
If they don't mind the size

Give my stomach to Milwaukee
If they run out of beer
Put my socks in a cedar box
Just get 'em out of here
Venus de Milo can have my arms
Look out! I've got your nose
Sell my heart to the junkman
And give my love to Rose

But please don't bury me
Down in the cold cold ground
I'd rather have 'em cut me up
And pass me all around
Throw my brain in a hurricane
The blind can have my eyes
And the deaf can take both of my ears
If they don't mind the size

Give my feet to the footloose
Careless, fancy free
Give my knees to the needy
Don't pull that stuff on me
Hand me down my walking cane
It's a sin to tell a lie
Send my mouth way down south
And kiss my ass goodbye

But please don't bury me
Down in that cold cold ground
No, I'd rather have 'em cut me up
And pass me all around
Throw my brain in a hurricane
And the blind can have my eyes
And the deaf can take both of my ears
If they don't mind the size
