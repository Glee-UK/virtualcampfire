 She Is A Rum One

As I strolled out one clear moon night,
One clear moon night in winter,
It was there I spied a pretty fair maid,
And I fell in behind her

She is a rum one, fol de riddle di day
But a bonny one, fol de riddle i doe.

She walked me up and she walked me down
And I kept close behind her,
And I asked to her the reason why
That she couldn't step no wider

She is a rum one, fol de riddle di do day
But a bonny one, fol de riddle i doe.

“Go away, go away, you foolish young man
And stop such foolish talking,
For it doth not suit young men,” she said,
“To pick up on women’s walking.”

She is a rum one, fol de riddle di do day
But a bonny one, fol de riddle i doe.

“Well I’m a doctor to my trade,
My friends they call me rare, o,
If you’ll tell me where your trouble lies,
I’ll fix it neat and fair, o.”

She is a rum one, fol de riddle di do day
But a bonny one, fol de riddle i doe.

“My trouble lies between my thighs
And there it is abiding,
It tickles me both night and day
And it keeps me from my striding.”

She is a rum one, fol de riddle di do day
But a bonny one, fol de riddle i doe.

I laid her down upon the bank
And I provided the plaster,
She jumped up unto her feet,
Says, “I hope you’ll never end it.”

She is a rum one, fol de riddle di do day
But a bonny one, fol de riddle i doe.

Well I gived to her my winter’s beef
Likewise my winter fuelling,
Far better than that she gived to me
Was a stable for my stallion.

She is a rum one, fol de riddle di day
But a bonny one, fol de riddle i doe.
