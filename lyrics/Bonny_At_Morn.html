 Bonny At Morn

<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>
The sheep’s in the meadow and the cow’s in the corn,
Thou’s ower lang in thy bed, bonny at morn.
The sheep’s in the meadow and the cow’s in the corn,
Thou’s ower lang in thy bed, bonny at morn.

Canny at night, bonny at morn,
Thou’s ower long in thy bed, bonny at morn.

The bird’s in the nest and the trout’s in the burn,
Thou hinders thy mother at many a turn.

We’re all laid idle wi’ keeping the bairn,
The lad winnot work and the lass winnot learn.
