<pre>
 Early, early in the spring
 Went out on board for to serve my king
 To leave my dearest dear behind
 Who often said that her heart was mine

 Oh when I had her in my arms
 I thought I could hear ten thousand charms
 Ten thousand promises kisses sweet
 Saying we'll get married next time we meet

 While I was sailing on the sea
 Not a moment of pleasure could I see
 For writing letters to my dearest dear
 But not one word from her could I hear

 When I returned to London town
 I walked the streets both up and down
 Inquiring there for my dearest dear
 But not one word from her could I hear

 I walked right up to her father's hall
 And there for my true love I did call
 They answered me she's married now
 She has married a man for to better her life

 I walked right up and her hand did take
 Saying all false promises now I'll break
 Whilst you proved false and I proved true
 So farewell love I'll bid you adieu

 Oh I'm going back onboard again
 Oh I'm going back for to serve my king
 Oh I'm going back where the bullets fly high
 Sail on deep waters until I die

 Oh don't go back onboard again
 Oh don't go back for to serve your king
 Oh don't go back where the bullets fly high
 There's many another girl much better than I
