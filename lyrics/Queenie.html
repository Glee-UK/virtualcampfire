 Queenie

<pre>
There’s a low-down tavern where the boys all go
To see Queenie, the star of the burlesque show
But the highlight of the evening is when on the stage she trips
And the band plays the polka while she strips
 <i>>
 Take ‘em off, take ‘em off!
 Cry the boys at the back
 Take ‘em off, take ‘em off!
 Be your natural self
 But Queenie is a lady and it’s only pantomime
 So she stops...... but only just in time
 </i>
There’s another side of Queenie that the boys don’t see
She dreams of a cottage surrounded by trees
But the payment of the mortgage takes an awful lot of chips
So the band plays the polka while she strips

Some day, Queenie will fall
Queenie, pride of them all
Some day, church bells will chime...
But only just in time!
