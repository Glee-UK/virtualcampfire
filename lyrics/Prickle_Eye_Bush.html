Oh, the prickle-eye bush
That breaks my heart so sore
If I ever get out of this prickle-eye bush
I’ll never get in it any more

Hangman stay your hand, O stay it for a while
For I think I see my (father) coming over yonder stile
(Father) have you brought me gold, or silver to see me free
To save my body from the cold, cold ground
And my neck from the gallows tree?

No, I have not brought you gold, or silver to see you free
To save your body from the cold, cold ground
And your neck from the gallows tree

 (Repeat verses for: Mother, Brother, Sister)

Hangman stay your hand, O stay it for a while
For I think I see my true love coming over yonder stile
True love, have you brought me gold, or silver to set me free
To save my body from the cold, cold ground
And my neck from the gallows tree?

Yes, I have brought you gold, and silver to set you free
To save your body from the cold, cold ground
And your neck from the gallows tree

Oh, the prickle-eye bush
That breaks my heart so sore
And now that I’m out of this prickle-eye bush
I’ll never get in it any more
