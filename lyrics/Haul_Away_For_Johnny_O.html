When I was a little lad or so my mother told me
 Away away, we'll haul away for Johnny-o
That if I did not kiss the girls my lips would all grow moldy
 Away, haul away, we'll haul away for Rosie
 Away, away, we'll haul away for Johnny-o

Away, haul away, haul away, we'll haul away for Johnny-o
Away, away haul away, we'll haul away together
Away, haul away, we'll haul away for Rosie
Away, away, we'll haul away for Johnny-o

King Louis was the king of France before the revolution
Away away, we'll haul away for Johnny-o
And then he got his head cut off which spoiled his constitution
Away, haul away, haul away, we'll haul away for Johnny-o
Away, away haul away, we'll haul away together
Away, haul away, we'll haul away for Rosie
Away, away, we'll haul away for Johnny-o

You call yourself a second mate but you can’t tie a bowline
 Away away, we'll haul away for Johnny-o
You cannot even stand up straight oh when the ship's a-rollin'
 Away, haul away, we'll haul away for Rosie
 Away, away, we'll haul away for Johnny-o

Away, haul away, haul away, we'll haul away for Johnny-o
Away, away haul away, we'll haul for better weather
Away, haul away, we'll haul away for Rosie
Away, away, we'll haul away for Johnny-o

The cook is in the galley making duff so handy
 Away away, we'll haul away for Johnny-o
The captain’s in his cabin drinking wine and brandy
 Away, haul away, we'll haul away for Rosie
 Away, away, we'll haul away for Johnny-o

Away, haul away, haul away, we'll haul away for Johnny-o
Away, away haul away, we'll haul away together
Away, haul away, we'll haul away for Rosie
Away, away, we'll haul away for Johnny-o
