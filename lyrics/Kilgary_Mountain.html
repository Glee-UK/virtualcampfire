As I was a going over Kilgary Mountain
I met Captain Farrell and his money he was counting
I drew forth my pistol and I rattled out my sabre
Saying, “Stand and deliver for I am a bold deceiver”
 <i>
 Mush-a-rigum-a-durum-dar
 Whack fol di daddy-o
 Whack fol di daddy-o
 There’s whisky in the jar
 </i>
I counted out his money and it made a pretty penny
So I put it in my pocket and I took it home to Jenny
She promised in her heart that she never would deceive me
But the devil take the women for they never can be easy

I went to Jenny’s chamber for to take a little slumber
I dreamt of gold and jewels and for sure it was no wonder
But Jenny drew my charges and filled them up with water
Then she fetched Captain Farrell just as fast as she could totter

‘Twas early in the morning I was wakened from my napping
I beheld a band of footman and the wily, handsome captain
I reached for my pistols for to begin the slaughter
But I could not discharge them for I couldn’t fire the water

I reached for my sabre but I found I hadn’t any
And I knew I had been taken by my darling sporting Jenny
And thus I did surrender, and a prisoner I was taken
And by a gay deceiver then I was all forsaken

They put me into prison without judge or writin’
For robbing Capt. Farrell on Kilgary Mountain
But they didn’t take my fists so I knocked the sentry down
And bid a fond farewell to the jail in Sligo town

If anyone can help me its my brother in the army
But I know not where he’s stationed, be it Cork or in Killarney
If only I could find him we’d go roving in Kilkenny
And I know he’d treat me better than my darling sporting Jenny

Now some folks takes delight in their carriages a rolling
And others takes delight in the hurley and the bowling
But me I takes delight in the juice of the barley
And courting pretty women in the morning bright and early
