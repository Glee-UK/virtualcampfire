<pre>
I’ve been over Snowdon, I’ve slept up on Crowdon
I’ve camped by the Wain Stones as well
I’ve sunbathed on Kinder, been burned to a cinder
And many more things I can tell

My rucksack has oft been me pillow
The heather has oft been my bed
And sooner than part from the mountains
I think I would rather be dead
 <i>
 I’m a rambler, I’m a rambler from Manchester way
 I get all me pleasure the hard moorland way
 I may be a wage slave on Monday
 But I am a free man on Sunday
 </i>
The day was just ending as I was descending
By Grimesbrook just by Upper Tor
When a voice cried, “Hey you!” in the way keepers do
He’d the worst face that ever I saw

The things that he said were unpleasant
In the teeth of his fury I said
“Sooner than part from the mountains
I think I would rather be dead”

He called me a louse and said, “Think of the grouse”
And I thought but I just couldn’t see
How old Kinder Scout and the moors round about
Couldn’t hold both the poor grouse and me

He said, “All this land is my master’s”
At that I stood shaking my head
No man has the right to own mountains
No more than the wide ocean bed

I once loved a maid, a spot-welder by trade
She was fair as the rowan in bloom
And the blue of her eye matched the June moorland sky
And I wooed her from April till June

On the day that we should have been married
I went for a ramble instead
For sooner than part from the mountains
I think I would rather be dead

So I walk where I will, over mountain and hill
And I’ll lie where the bracken is deep
I belong to the mountains, the clear-running fountains
Where the grey rocks rise rugged and steep

I’ve seen the white hare in the gully
And the curlew fly high overhead
And sooner than part from the mountains
I think I would rather be dead
