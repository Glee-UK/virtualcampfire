  Calling On

<pre>
Good people pray heed a petition
Your attention we beg and we crave
And if you are inclined for to listen
An abundance of pastime we’ll have
We have come to relate many stories
Concerning our forefathers’ times
And we trust they will drive out your worries
Of this we are all in one mind

Many tales of the poor and the gentry
Of labour and love will arise
There are no finer songs in this country
In Scotland and Ireland likewise
There’s one thing more needing mention
The dances we’ll dance all in fun
So now that you’ve heard our intention
We’ll play on to the beat of the drum
