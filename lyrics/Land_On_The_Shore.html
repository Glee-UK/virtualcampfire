Now my friends, our meeting is over
Sisters we must part
And if on Earth we meet no more
I'll keep you in my heart
And we'll land on the shore
And we'll land on that shore
And we'll land on the shore
And be safe forevermore

Now my friends, our meeting is over
Brothers we must part
And if on Earth we meet no more
I'll keep you in my heart
And we'll land on the shore
And we'll land on that shore
And we'll land on the shore
And be safe forevermore

Now my friends, our meeting is over
Fathers, we must part
And if on Earth we meet no more
I'll keep you in my heart
And we'll land on the shore
And we'll land on that shore
And we'll land on the shore
And be safe forevermore

Now my friends, our meeting is over
Mothers, we must part
And if on Earth we meet no more
I'll keep you in my heart
And we'll land on the shore
And we'll land on that shore
And we'll land on the shore
And be safe forevermore

And we'll land on the shore
And we'll land on that shore
And we'll land on the shore
And be safe forevermore
