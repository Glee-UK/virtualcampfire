<pre>
As I went to Derby, all on a market day
I spied the biggest ram, sir, that ever fed on hay
<i>
And he rambled, rambled
Rambled all around, in and out of town,
And he rambled,
Didn't he ramble
He rambled till them butchers cut him down
</i>
He had four feet to stand, sir
He had four feet to stand
And every one of those four feet it covered an acre of land

And he rambled, rambled
Rambled all around, in and out of town
Didn't he ramble
He rambled till them butchers cut him down

Well the wool on the this ram's back, sir, it reached up to the sky
And the eagles built their nests there
For I heard the young ones cry

The horns on this rams head sir
They reached up to the moon
A man went up in January and didn't get back till June
