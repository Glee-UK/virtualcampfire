As I went to Derby,
 All on a market day
I spied the biggest ram, sir,
 That ever fed on hay
<i>
And he rambled, rambled
Rambled all around, in and out of town,
And he rambled,
Didn't he ramble
He rambled till them butchers cut him down
</i>
Well he had four feet to stand, sir
 He had four feet to stand
And every one of those four feet
 It covered an acre of land
<i>
And he rambled, rambled
Rambled all around, in and out of town
And he rambled,
Didn't he ramble
He rambled till them butchers cut him down
<i>

Well the wool on the this ram's back, sir,
 It reached up to the sky
And the eagles built their nests there
 For I heard the young ones cry

<i>
And he rambled, rambled
Rambled all around, in and out of town
And he rambled,
Didn't he ramble
He rambled till them butchers cut him down
</i>

The horns on this rams head, sir
 They reached up to the moon
A man went up in January
 And didn't get back till June

<i>
And he rambled, rambled
Rambled all around, in and out of town
And he rambled,
Didn't he ramble
He rambled till them butchers cut him down
</i>

Well the butcher that cut him down, sir
 Was drowned in the blood
And the little boy who held the pole
 Was washed away in the flood

<i>
And he rambled, rambled
Rambled all around, in and out of town
And he rambled,
Didn't he ramble
He rambled till them butchers cut him down
</i>
