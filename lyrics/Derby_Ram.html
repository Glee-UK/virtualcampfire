<pre>
As I went to Derby, all on a market day
I spied the biggest ram, sir, that ever was fed upon hay

And he rambled, rambled
Rambled all around in and out of town
Didn't he ramble
He rambled till them butchers cut him down

He had four feet to stand, sir
He had four feet to stand
and every one of those four feet covered an acre of land

And he rambled, rambled
Rambled all around in and out of town
Didn't he ramble
He rambled till them butchers cut him down

Well the wool on the this ram's back, sir, reached up to the sky
 The eagles

The horns on this rams head sir
They reached up to the moon
A man went up in January and didn't get back till June
