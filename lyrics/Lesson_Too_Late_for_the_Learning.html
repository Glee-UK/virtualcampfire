 A Lesson Too Late for the Learning
</h1>
<div style="width:25em; text-align:left;">
<pre>
It’s a lesson too late for the learning
Made of sand, made of sand
In the wink of an eye my heart is turning
In your hand, in your hand
 <i>
 Are you going away with no word of farewell?
 Will there be not a trace left behind?
 I could have loved you better, didn’t mean to be unkind
 You know that was the last thing on my mind
 </i>
As we walk all my thoughts are a-tumbling
Round and round, round and round
Underneath our feet the subway’s rumbling
Underground, underground

As I lie in my bed in the morning
Without you, without you
Every song in my heart dies a-borning
Without you, without you

You have reasons a-plenty for going,
This I know, this I know
For the weeds have been steadily growing,
Please don’t go, please don’t go
