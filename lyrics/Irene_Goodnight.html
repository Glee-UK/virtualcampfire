 Irene, good night Irene
 Irene, good night
 Good night Irene, good night Irene
 I kiss you in my dreams
 </i>
I asked your mother for you
She told me you was too young
I wish to the Lord I’d never seen your face
I’m sorry you ever was born

Last Saturday night I got married
Me an’ my wife settled down
Now me an’ my wife are parted
Gonna take me a stroll uptown

You caused me to weep, you caused me to mourn
You caused me to leave my home
But the very last words I heard her say
Were, Please sing me one more song

Stop rambling and stop gambling
Quit staying out late at night
Go home to your wife and your family
Sit down by the fireside bright

I love Irene, God knows I do
I love her ‘til the sea runs dry
If Irene turns her back on me
I’m gonna take morphine and die

Sometimes I live in the country
Sometimes I live in the town
Sometimes I have a great notion
To jump in the river and drown
