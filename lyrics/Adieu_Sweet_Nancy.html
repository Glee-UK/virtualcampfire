<pre>
Adieu sweet lovely Nancy, ten thousand times adieu,
I’m a goin’ across the ocean, love, for to seek for something new.
Come change your ring with me dear girl, come change your ring with me,
That it might be a token of true love while I am out at sea.

When I am far out at sea you’ll know not where I am,
Kind letters I will write to you from every foreign land.
The secrets of my heart dear girl are the best of my good will,
So let your body be where it might my heart will be with you still.

There’s a heavy storm a-risin’, see how it gathers round,
While we poor souls on the ocean tide are a fightin’ for the Crown.
There is nothing to protect us love nor to keep us from the cold.
On the ocean wide where we must fight like jolly seamen bold.

There's tinkers, tailors and shoemakers lie a-snorin’ fast asleep,
While we poor souls on the ocean wide go ploughin’ through the deep.
Our officers commanding us its them we must obey,
Expectin’ every moment for to get cast away.

But when the wars are over there’ll be peace on every shore,
We’ll return to our wives and our families and the girls that we adore.
We will call for liquor merrily, we will spend our money free,
And when our money is all gone we will boldly go to sea.
