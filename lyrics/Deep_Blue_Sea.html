Deep blue sea, Willie deep blue sea (x3)
It was Willie, what got drownded in the deep blue sea.

Dig his grave with a silver spade (x3)
It was Willie, what got drownded in the deep blue sea.

Sew his shroud with a silken thread (x3)
It was Willie, what got drownded in the deep blue sea.

Lower him down on a golden chain (x3)
It was Willie, what got drownded in the deep blue sea.
