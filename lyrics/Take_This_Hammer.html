<pre>
Take this hammer, carry it to the Captain
Take this hammer, carry it to the Captain
Take this hammer, carry it to the Captain
Tell him I’m gone, Tell him I’m gone

If he ask you was I running...
You can tell him I was flying, Lord, you can tell him I was flying

If he ask you was I laughin’...
You can tell him I was crying, Lord, you can tell him I was crying

I don’t want no cold iron shackles...
‘Cause they hurts my feet Lord, ‘cause they hurts my feet

I don’t want no cornbread and molasses...
‘Cause they hurts my pride Lord, ‘cause they hurts my pride

Swing this hammer, it looks like silver...
But it feels like lead Lord, it feels like lead
